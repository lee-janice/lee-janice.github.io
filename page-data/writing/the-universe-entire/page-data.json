She almost could have missed the whole event, prancing in the meadow\nas she was—one in her position could not help but gaze in upward bliss at the hues of saffron and\nrose and lavender that bloomed across the setting skies. She leapt up with glee, relishing in how\nthe gentle plush of the grass caught her fall and seemed to propel her ever higher and higher and\nhigher, oblivious to the fine trails of ash that lay in her wake. Just as she was about to burst into\na full gallop with the immensity of it all, she—and this was her folly—glanced down upon herself,\npromptly stumbling over her two left feet.</p>\n<p>She landed flat on her face with a muted <em>thump!</em> and a grayish puff swept a cloud of particulates\ninto her eyes and her mouth. For a moment, all she could manage to do was lie in a daze. The sky\ntumbled and churned in great circles overhead. In the still of her stupor, the dust finally settled to\nthe earth—and only then did she attempt to blindly grasp around her for some bare modicum of\nsense. She tore up a clenched fist full of grass-blades and splayed it open to a <em>poof</em>.</p>\n<p>Her spine stiffened and she shot upwards in shock. She could now see clearly the ripples of soot\nthat streaked her wayward path through the field. She hobbled to her feet, with a half-hope that\nthe higher vantage point would dispel the irregular scene, but the only thing she now grasped was\njust how deeply the blemished veins ran.</p>\n<p>She began to feel a chill. In the dying light, she could spot others in the distance—a couple\nintertwined, a flock of friends in celebration, a child and a hound—but failed to detect in any of their\nsilhouettes a sign of the icy panic that now inched and nestled deep into her bones.</p>\n<p>     <em>What’s happening to me?</em></p>\n<p>She fled, homeward bound, not daring to glance down at the clouds of dust that smoked from her\nstaggering gait. She collapsed against her doorway, fumbling with the lock, and finally broke into\nthe room with a haggard leap. She turned and barricaded the door, <em>one, two, three,</em> and shuttered\nthe blinds in a vehement clap.</p>\n<p>By now it was night, her room cold and pitch black. She couldn’t bring herself to flip on the ceiling\nlight, fearing the scene that it might reveal, and instead lit a candle with a match and a <em>hissss</em>. The\nflame flickered precariously. Overcome by a morbid curiosity, she peered into a mirror.</p>\n<p>A distorted figure leered back. This creature was so foreign to her, and impossibly distant, as though\nthe glass had severed the image’s tether to reality in one cold stroke. Trembling, she brought her\nhand to caress its face with what she thought was truth—<em>was that a moment of pause?</em> She ran\nher fingers down its body. It felt so strange, so grotesque: her consciousness hung to it by a mere\nthread.</p>\n<p>Everything was in its wrong place. Was her own flesh and bone, too, fading away? She began to\ngasp for certainty as her rib cage spasmed and contorted in her sickly reflection. The left side of her\nmouth drooped before her eyes. The asymmetry was nauseating. A shaky inhale rattled her frame,\nand she coughed.</p>\n<p>     <em>Why a cough?</em></p>\n<p>She tore her gaze from the mirror image. The walls around her were crumbling. Plumes of dust\ngrasped for and choked the air, and her breath caught on a blade.</p>\n<p>     <em>No, please, not again—</em></p>\n<p>She threw herself to the floor, sobbing, using spit and tears and blood and snot in her desperation\nto plaster together the splitting walls, smearing the paste over the fractaling gaps—but how\ninsurmountably wide they were—and the more fiercely she scraped and prayed and clawed to piece them\nback together, the faster the earthy substance disintegrated under her fingertips. The worst became\nundeniably, horrifically true. This ruin was her own doing.</p>\n<p>There was no shield from the world now. As far as one’s eye could discern, all structure and form\nand shelter had crumbled away. A bare existence lay strewn on its remains. She numbed herself to\nthe ground, rocking back and forth, humming and humming a hope into the ether,</p>\n<p>     <em>is anyone there?</em></p>\n<p>Was she even sure that there was ever someone there? Was it always just dust?</p>\n<p>A piercing tone began to fade in and out of her wavering perception. Through her tear-stricken eyes\nshe could barely make out the constellations overhead—but she fastened the last of her hopes to\nthem, spinning her around and around in their celestial dance. In this great whirling, it all soon felt\njust like a dream...</p>\n<p>Then, one by one, a light was extinguished from the heavens and fell towards the earth.</p>\n<p><em>Thump. thump. thump.</em> Each speck of stardust thumped like thunder, echoing and booming in her\nears. But she felt nothing—in her numbness she lay dormant as the dust made hilltops and peaks\nand valleys and caverns of her body. A muted thought washed over her of how many stars had\nonce littered the skies and how much there was left to fall. The showering turned into a torrential\ndownpour. She waited for it to consume her.</p>\n<p>But then some visceral thing erupted—some primal frenzy to persist, to not be buried in this—and\nshe began to claw upwards through the endless mounds, tearing at them with limb over limb in her\nstruggle to stay afloat, so unsure of where her body ended and the dust began—maybe she was losing\nherself to it—and it scorched her lungs as she labored for each gasp of air, stopping her heart—</p>\n<p>And she hit a wall.</p>\n<p>There was no space left to go. The dust compacted inward, becoming ever more dense, splaying\nwhatever remained of her being against this dome that immobilized her. She was being compressed\nby nothing into nothing, nothing, nothing...</p>\n<hr style=\"border-top: dotted 1px;\" />\n<p>But just as she was fading away, from all directions, came a resounding golden chord!</p>\n<p>     <em>I Am!</em></p>\n<p>Answering the call, she pushed blindly into the impasse—</p>\n<p>     —and it burst open, flinging her far out into a void, beyond the known, cast forth on a free-fall\ninto a vast expanse of potentialities; she saw in a dizzy splendor the tendrils of matter that blossomed\noutwards from the rupture of her cage, and the patterns of chaos and cosmos that intertwined in\na kaleidoscopic dance.</p>\n<p>And then, in a speck of dust that chanced to float her by... she saw the\nUniverse entire. She couldn’t help but laugh.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Universe Entire","subtitle":"A short story about perspective","created":"25 of January 2024","updated":"13 of February 2024"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing/the-universe-entire/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
