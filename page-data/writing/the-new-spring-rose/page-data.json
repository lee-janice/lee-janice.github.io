But shimm’ring spark of Nature’s blessed eye!\nbreaks through the bitter winds of Winter’s hold,\nand fast alights a thing once been decried;\nis this of what Time’s muses had foretold? A measure and a mind does this defy,\nand smells as sweet by any mortal stele.\nAs the new Spring rose, the old Death had died,\nand the one act left is for one to feel.             Though Winter will return sure as the tide,\n            as such is Love, and such is Life besides.
