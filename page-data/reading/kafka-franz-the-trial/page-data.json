You may object that these aren't proceedings at all, and you're  certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such... what has  happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I  don't take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against  many people. I speak for them, not myself... The examining magistrate here beside me has  just given one of you a secret signal. So there are those among you who are being directed  from up here... there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and  in my case, behind the arrest and today's inquiry, there exists an extensive organization.  An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates  who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including  the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and  other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won't shy away from the word... So!... I see you're all  officials, you're the corrupt band I was speaking about; you've crowded in here to listen and  snoop, you've formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn  how to lead innocent men astray.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":3,"chapter_title":"Initial Inquiry","description":"","page_number":49,"quote":"The two parties, which had appeared to hold such contrasting opinions before, mingled with one  another, some people pointing their fingers at K., others at the examining magistrate.

But K. didn't want to  go to the infirmary; that was precisely what he wanted to avoid, being led farther on, for the farther he went,  the worse things would get... in reality it would have done him a good deal to sit down; he felt seasick.  He thought he was on a ship, rolling in heavy seas. It seemed to him that the waters were pounding against  the wooden walls, there was a roar from the depths of the hallway like the sound of breaking waves, the hallway  seemed to pitch and roll, lifting and lowering the waiting clients on both sides... He realized at last that  they were speaking to him, but he couldn't understand them; he heard only the noise that filled everything,  through which a steady, high-pitched sound like a siren seemed to emerge... he heard beside him: \"First he  wants to leave, then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the exit and he doesn't move.\"\n","notes":"It's an intriguing depiction of anxiety, panic attacks, and mental spiraling.

Just don't attract attention!  Keep calm, no matter how much it seems counter to good sense. Try to realize that this vast  judicial organism remains, so to speak, inn a state of eternal equilibrium, and that if you  change something on your own where you are, you can cut the ground out from your own feet and  fall, while the vast organism easily compensates for the minor disturbance at some other  spot-after all, everything is interconnected-and remains unchanged, if not, which is likely,  even more resolute, more vigilant, more severe, more malicious.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":7,"chapter_title":"Lawyer/The Manufacturer/The Painter","description":"K. regarding his trial","page_number":125,"quote":"Above all, if he wanted to get anywhere, he had to reject the notion of any possible guilt  right from the start.

A man from  the country comes to this doorkeeper and requests admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper  says that he can't grant him admittance now. The man thinks it over and then asks if  he'll be allowed to enter later. 'It's possible,' says the doorkeeper, 'but not now.'  Since the gate to the Law stands open as always, and the doorkeeper steps aside,  the man bends down to look through the gate into the interior. WWhen the doorkeeper  sees this he laughs and says, 'If you're so drawn to it, go ahead and try to enter,  even though I've forbidden it. But bear this in mind: I'm powerful. And I'm only the  lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall, however, stand doorkeepers each more powerful than  the one before. The mere sight of the third is more than even I can bear.'... he decides  he would prefer to wait until he receives permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a  stool and lets him sit down at the side of the door. He sits there for days and years...  Finally his eyes grow dim and he no longer knows whether it's really getting darker around  him or if his eyes are merely deceiving him. And yet in the darkness he now sees a radiance  that streams forth inextinguishably from the door of the Law. He doesn't have much longer  to live now. Before he dies, everything he has experienced over the years coalesces in his  mind into a single question he has never asked the doorkeeper... 'Everyone strives to reach  the Law,' says the man, 'how does it happen, then, that in all these years no one but me  has requested admittance. The doorkeeper sees that the man is nearing his end, and in order  to reach his failing hearing, he roars at him: 'No one else could gain admittance here,  because this entrance was meant solely for you. I'm going to go and shut it now.'\"\n","notes":"Reminds me of infinite regress, G.O.D.

Like a light flicking on, the casements of a window  flew open, a human figure, faint and insubstantial at that distance and height,  leaned far out abruptly, and stretched both arms out even further. Who was it?  A friend? A good person? Someone who cared? Someone who wanted to help? Was it just  one person? Was it everyone? Was there still help? Were there objections that had  been forgotten? Of course there were. Logic is no doubt unshakable, but it can't  withstand a person who wants to live. Where was the judge he'd never seen? Where was  the high court he'd never reached?
