In other words, those who cannot compete, die... I do not accept... history as determinism. I embrace history as possibility where we can demystify the evil in this perverse fatalism that characterizes the neoliberal discourse in the end of this century.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":null,"chapter_title":"Introduction","description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Although he did not hold our hands as we crossed the threshold of the twenty-first century, his words of wisdom, his penetrating and insightful ideas, his courage to denounce in order to announce, his courage to love and \"to speak about love without fear of being called ascientific, if not antiscientific,\" his humility, and his humanity make him immortal -- a forever-present force that keeps alive our understanding of history as possibility.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":null,"chapter_title":"Foreword","description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"His early sharing of the life of the poor also led him to the discovery of what he describes as the \"culture of silence\" of the dispossessed. He came to realize that their ignorance and lethargy were the direct product of the whole situation of economic, social, and political domination -- and of the paternalism -- of which they were victims... And it became clear to him that the whole educational system was one of the major instruments for the maintenance of this culture of silence.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":null,"chapter_title":"Foreword","description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Freire is able to do this because he operates on one basic assumption: that man's ontological vocation (as he calls it) is to be a Subject who acts upon and transforms his world, and in so doing moves toward ever new possibilities of fuller and richer life individually and collectively.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":null,"chapter_title":"Preface","description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"The radical... is not afraid to confront, to listen, to see the world unveiled. This person is not afraid to meet the people or to enter into dialogue with them. This person does not consider himself or herself the proprietor of history. or of all people, or the liberator of the oppressed; but he or she does commit himself or herself, within history, to fight at their side... From these pages I hope at least the following will endure: my trust in the people, and my faith in men and women, and in the creation of a world in which it will be easier to love.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"In order for this struggle to have meaning, the oppressed must not, in seeking to regain their humanity (which is a way to create it), become in turn oppressors of the oppressors, but rather restorers of the humanity of both.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"But almost always, during the initial stage of the struggle, the oppressed, instead of striving for liberation, tend themselves to become oppressors, or \"sub-oppressors.\" The very structure of their thought has been conditioned by the contradictions of the concrete, existential situation by which they were shaped... This phenomenon derives from the fact that the oppressed, at a certain moment of their existential experience, adopt an attitude of \"adhesion\" to the oppressor.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"The central problem is this: How can the oppressed, as divided, unauthentic beings, participate in developing the pedagogy of their liberation? Only as they discover themselves to be \"hosts\" of the oppressor can they contribute to the midwifery of their liberating pedagogy. As long as they live in the duality which to be is to be like, and to be like is to be like the oppressor, this contribution is impossible. The pedagogy of the oppressed is an instrument for their critical discovery that both they and their oppressors are manifestations of dehumanization.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"In order for the oppressed to be able to wage the struggle for their liberation, they must perceive the reality of oppression not as a closed world from which there is no exit, but as a limiting situation which they can transform. This perception is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for liberation; it must become the motivating force for liberating action. Nor does the discovery by the oppressed that they exist in dialectical relationship to the oppressor, as his antithesis -- that without them the oppressor could not exist -- in itself constitute liberation. The oppressed can overcome the contradiction in which they are caught only when this perception enlists them in the struggle to free themselves.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":1,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Action is human only when it is not merely an occupation but also a preoccupation, that is, when it is not dichotomized from reflection.

This discovery cannot be purely intellectual but must involve action; nor can it be limited to mere activism, but must include serious reflection: only then will it be a praxis.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":2,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"The teacher talks about reality as if it were motionless, static, compartmentalized, and predictable. Or else he expounds on a topic completely alien to the existential experience of the students. His task is to \"fill\" the students with the contents of his narration -- contents which are detached from reality, disconnected from the totality that engendered them and could give them significance... The more meekly the receptacles permit themselves to be filled, the better students they are.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":2,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Implicit in the banking concept is the assumption of a dichotomy between human beings and the world: a person is merely *in* the world, not *with* the world or with others; the individual is spectator, not re-creator...\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":null,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Solidarity requires true communication, and the concept by which such an educator is guided fears and proscribes communication. Yet only through communication can human life hold meaning... Authentic thinking, thinking that is concerned about reality, does not take place in ivory tower isolation, but only in communication.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":3,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Dialogue cannot exist, however, in the absence of a profound love for the world and for people. The naming of the world, which is an act of creation and re-creation, is not possible if it is not infused with love.  Love is at the same time the foundation of dialogue and dialogue itself. It is thus necessarily the task of responsible Subjects and cannot exist in a relation of domination. Domination reveals the pathology of love: sadism in the dominator and masochism in the dominated. Because love is an act of courage, not of fear, love is commitment to others. No matter where the oppressed are found, the act of love is commitment to their causeâ€”the cause of liberation.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":3,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"It is to the reality which mediates men, and to the perception of that reality held by educators and people, that we must go to find the program content of education. The investigation of what I have termed the people s \"thematic universe\"â€”the complex of their \"generative themes\"â€”inaugurates the dialogue of education as the practice of freedom.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":3,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"The important thing, from the point of view of libertarian education, is for the people to come to feel like masters of their thinking by discussing the thinking and views of the world explicitly or implicitly manifest in their own suggestions and those of their comrades. Because this view of education starts with the conviction that it cannot present its own program but must search for this program dialogically with the people, it serves to introduce the pedagogy of the oppressed, in the elaboration of which the oppressed must participate.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":4,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"But human activity consists of action and reflection: it is praxis; it is transformation of the world. And as praxis, it requires theory to illuminate it. Human activity is theory and practice; it is reflection and action. It cannot, as I stressed in chapter 2, be reduced to either verbalism or activism.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":4,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Many persons, bound to a mechanistic view of reality, do not perceive that the concrete situation of individuals conditions their consciousness of the world, and that in turn this consciousness conditions their attitudes and their ways of dealing with reality. They think that reality can be transformed mechanistically, without posing the persons false consciousness of reality as a problem or, through revolutionary action, developing a consciousness which is less and less false.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":4,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Presenting (with his customary clarity) the problem of necrophilia and biophilia, Fromm analyzes the objective conditions which generate each condition, whether in the home (parent-child relations in a climate of indifference and oppression or of love and freedom), or in a sociocultural context. If children reared in an atmosphere of lovelessness and oppression, children whose potency has been frustrated, do not manage during their youth to take the path of authentic rebellion, they will either drift into total indifference, alienated from reality by the authorities and the myths the latter have used to \"shape\" them; or they may engage in forms of destructive action.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":4,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"The atmosphere of the home is prolonged in the school, where the students soon discover that (as in the home) in order to achieve some satisfaction they must adapt to the precepts which have been set from above. One of these precepts is not to think.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":4,"chapter_title":null,"description":null,"page_number":null,"quote":"Internalizing paternal authority through the rigid relationship structure emphasized by the school, these young people tend when they become professionals (because of the very fear of freedom instilled by these relationships) to repeat the rigid patterns in which they were miseducated. This phenomenon, in addition to their class position, perhaps explains why so many professionals adhere to anti-dialogical action.\n","notes":null}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/reading/freire-paulo-pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/","author_first":"Paulo","author_last":"Freire","title":"Pedagogy of the Oppressed"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
