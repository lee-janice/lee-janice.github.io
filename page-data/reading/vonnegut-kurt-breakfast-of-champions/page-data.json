They can no more feel or reason than grandfather clocks. “The Creator of the Universe would now like to apologize not only for the capricious, jostling companionship he provided during the test, but for the trashy, stinking condition of the planet itself. The Creator programmed robots to abuse it for millions of years, so it would be a poisonous, festering cheese when you got here. Also, He made sure it would be desperately crowded by programming robots, regardless of their living conditions, to crave sexual intercourse and adore infants more than almost anything.”\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":23,"chapter_title":null,"description":"The message continues","page_number":198,"quote":"“He also programmed robots to write books and magazines and newspapers for you, and television and radio shows, and stage shows, and films. They wrote songs for you. The Creator of the Universe had them invent hundreds of religions, so you would have plenty to choose among. He had them kill each other by the millions, for this purpose only: that you be amazed. They have committed every possible atrocity and every possible kindness unfeelingly, automatically, inevitably, to get a reaction from Y-O-U.”\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":23,"chapter_title":null,"description":"The message continues","page_number":199,"quote":"“Every time you went into the library,” said the book, “the Creator of the Universe held His breath. With such a higgledy-piggledy cultural smorgasbord before you, what would you, with your free will, choose?” “Your parents were fighting machines and self-pitying machines,” said the book. “Your mother was programmed to bawl out your father for being a defective moneymaking machine, and your father was programmed to bawl her out for being a defective housekeeping machine. They were programmed to bawl each other out for being defective loving machines. “Then your father was programmed to stomp out of the house and slam the door. This automatically turned your mother into a weeping machine. And your father would go down to a tavern where he would get drunk with some other drinking machines. Then all the drinking machines would go to a whorehouse and rent fucking machines. And then your father would drag himself home to become an apologizing machine. And your mother would become a very slow forgiving machine.”\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":23,"chapter_title":null,"description":"Dwayne's reception of the message","page_number":199,"quote":"Dwayne got to his feet now, having wolfed down tens of thousands of words of such solipsistic whimsey in ten minutes or so. He walked stiffly over to the piano bar. What made him stiff was his awe of his own strength and righteousness. He dared not use his full strength in merely walking, for fear of destroying the new Holiday Inn with footfalls. He did not fear for his own life, Trout's book assured him that he had already been killed twenty-three times. On each occasion, the Creator of the Universe had patched him up and got him going again. Dwayne restrained himself in the name of elegance rather than safety. He was going to respond to his new understanding of life with finesse, for an audience of two—himself and his Creator.\n","notes":null},{"chapter_number":null,"chapter_title":"Epilogue","description":"Vonnegut confronts his creation","page_number":225,"quote":"I stopped with the tips of my shoes on the rim of the narrow field of his downcast eyes. “Mr. Trout, I love you,” I said gently. “I have broken your mind to pieces.

Most of all, we hunger for symbols which have not been poisoned by great sins our nation has committed, such as slavery and genocide and criminal neglect, or by tinhorn commercial greed and cunning. “Look up, Mr. Trout,” I said, and I waited patiently. “Kilgore—?” The old man looked up, and he had my father's wasted face when my father was a widower—when my father was an old old man. He saw that I held an apple in my hand. “I am approaching my fiftieth birthday, Mr. Trout,” I said. “I am cleansing and renewing myself for the very different sorts of years to come.
