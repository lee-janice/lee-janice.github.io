But things were much better now. He had a pleasant little apartment, and his daughter was getting an excellent education. His mother was incinerated in the Dresden fire-storm. So it goes.

A whole city gets burned down, and thousands and thousands of people are killed. And then this one American foot soldier is arrested in the ruins for taking a teapot. And he&#x27;s given a regular trial, and then he&#x27;s shot by a firing squad.&#x27;
&#x27;Um,&#x27; said O&#x27;Hare.
&#x27;Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s really where the climax should come?&#x27; &#x27;I don&#x27;t know anything about it,&#x27; he said.

</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">8</em><br/><span>Reflection on his education</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I think about my education sometimes. I went to the University of Chicago for a while after the Second World War. I was a student in the Department of Anthropology. At that time, they were teaching that there was absolutely no difference between anybody. They may be teaching that still. Another thing they taught was that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting. Shortly before my father died, he said to me, &#x27;You know-you never wrote a story with a villain in it.&#x27; I told him that was one of the things I learned in college after the war.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">13</em><br/><span>Reflections on time</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>And I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">13</em><br/><span>The writings of Céline, a French soldier in WWI</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>No art is possible without a dance with death, he wrote.
The truth is death, he wrote. I&#x27;ve fought nicely against it as long as I could... danced with it, festooned it, waltzed it around... decorated it with streamers, titillated it...
Time obsessed him. Miss Ostrovsky reminded me of the amazing scene in Death on the Installment Plan where Céline wants to stop the bustling of a street crowd. He screams on paper, Make them stop ... don&#x27;t let them move anymore at all ... There, make them freeze ... once and for all! ... So that they won&#x27;t disappear anymore!
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">14</em><br/><span>Reflections on time</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>The time would not pass. Somebody was playing with the clocks, and not only with the electric clocks, but the wind-up kind, too. The second hand on my watch would twitch once, and a year would pass, and then it would twitch again.
There was nothing I could do about it. As an Earthling., I had to believe whatever clocks said-and calendars.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">14</em><br/><span>Tales of destruction</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction. The sun was risen upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo-ar, I read. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven; and He overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
So it goes.
Those were vile people in both those cities, as is well known. The world was better off without them.
And Lot&#x27;s wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.
She was turned to a pillar of salt. So it goes.
People aren&#x27;t supposed to look back. I&#x27;m certainly not going to do it anymore.
I&#x27;ve finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun.
This one is a failure, and had to be, since it was written by a pillar of salt. It begins like this:
Listen:
Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.
It ends like this:
Poo-tee-weet?
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">15</em><br/><span>Billy&#x27;s lessons from Tralfamadore</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy was working on his second letter when the first letter was published. The second letter started out like this:
&#x27;The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.
&#x27;When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is &quot;so it goes.&quot;&#x27;
And so on.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">24</em><br/><span>Coming unstuck in time</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy Pilgrim had stopped in the forest. He was leaning against a tree with his eyes closed. His head was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring. He was like a poet in the Parthenon.
This was when Billy first came unstuck in time. His attention began to swing grandly through the full arc of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. There wasn&#x27;t anybody else there, or any thing. There was just violet light and a hum.
And then Billy swung into life again, going backwards until he was in pre-birth, which was red light and bubbling sounds. And then he swung into life again and stopped. He was a little boy taking a shower with his hairy father at the Ilium Y.M.C.A. He smelled chlorine from the swimming pool next door, heard the springboard boom.
Little Billy was terrified, because his father had said Billy was going to learn to swim by the method of sink-or-swim. Ms father was going to throw Billy into the deep end, and Billy was going to damn well swim.
It was like an execution. Billy was numb as his father carried him from the shower room to the pool. His eyes were closed. When he opened his eyes, he was on the bottom of the pool, and there was beautiful music everywhere. He lost consciousness, but the music went on. He dimly sensed that somebody was rescuing him. Billy resented that.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">25</em><br/><span>Billy&#x27;s visit with his mother</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>From there he traveled in time to 1965. He was forty-one years old, and he was visiting his decrepit mother at Pine Knoll, an old people&#x27;s home he had put her in only a month before. She had caught pneumonia, and wasn&#x27;t expected to live. She did live, though, for years after that.
Her voice was nearly gone, so, in order to hear her, Billy had to put his ear right next to her papery lips. She evidently had something very important to say.
&#x27;How ...?&#x27; she began, and she stopped. She was too tired. She hoped that she wouldn&#x27;t have to say the rest of the sentence, and that Billy would finish it for her
But Billy had no idea what was on her mind. &#x27;How what, Mother?&#x27; he prompted.
She swallowed hard, shed some tears. Then she gathered energy from all over her ruined body, even from her toes and fingertips. At last she bad accumulated enough to whisper this complete sentence:
&#x27;How did I get so old ?&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">27</em><br/><span>Billy in the heat of war</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy Pilgrim, there in the creekbed, thought he, Billy Pilgrim, was turning to steam painlessly. If everybody would leave him alone for just a little while, he thought, he wouldn&#x27;t cause anybody any more trouble. He would turn to steam and float up among the treetops.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">29</em><br/><span>Mopping up</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>The Germans and the dog were engaged in a military operation which had an amusingly self-explanatory name, a human enterprise which is seldom described in detail, whose name alone, when reported as news or history, gives many war enthusiasts a sort of post-coital satisfaction. It is, in the imagination of combat&#x27;s fans, the divinely listless loveplay that follows the orgasm of victory. It is called &#x27;mopping up.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">29</em><br/><span>Holy boots</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Those boots were almost all he owned in this world. They were his home. An anecdote: One time a recruit was watching him bone and wax those golden boots, and he held one up to the recruit and said, &#x27;If you look in there deeply enough, you&#x27;ll see Adam and Eve.&#x27;
Billy Pilgrim had not heard this anecdote. But, lying on the black ice there, Billy stared into the patina of the corporal&#x27;s boots, saw Adam and Eve in the golden depths. They were naked. They were so innocent, so vulnerable, so eager to behave decently. Billy Pilgrim loved them.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">33</em><br/><span>A prayer and time</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping going, even though he was unenthusiastic about living. A lot of patients who saw the prayer on Billy&#x27;s wall told him that it helped them to keep going, too. It went like this
GOD GRANT ME
THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT
THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE
COURAGE
TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN,
AND WISDOM ALWAYS
TO TELL THE
DIFFERENCE.
Among the things Billy Pilgrim could not change were the past, the present and the future.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">36</em><br/><span>Upon capturing the Americans</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>One of them singled out Billy&#x27;s face for a moment, then focused at infinity again. There was a tiny plume of smoke at infinity. There was a battle there. People were dying there. So it goes.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">38</em><br/><span>In the prisoner&#x27;s train cars</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Even though Billy&#x27;s train wasn&#x27;t moving, its boxcars were kept locked tight. Nobody was to get off until the final destination. To the guards who walked up and down outside, each car became a single organism which ate and drank and excreted through its ventilators. It talked or sometimes yelled through its ventilators, too. In went water and loaves of blackbread and sausage and cheese, and out came shit and piss and language.
Human beings in there were excreting into steel helmets, which were passed to the people at the ventilators, who dumped them. Billy was a dumper. The human beings also passed canteens, which guards would fill with water. When food came in, the human beings were quiet and trusting and beautiful. They shared.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">41</em><br/><span>Meeting the Tralfamadorians</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&#x27;Welcome aboard, Mr. Pilgrim,&#x27; said the loudspeaker. &#x27;Any questions?&#x27;
Billy licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: &#x27;Why me?&#x27;
That is a very Earthling question to ask, Mr. Pilgrim. Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything ? Because this moment simply is. Have you ever seen bugs trapped in amber?&#x27;
&#x27;Yes.&#x27; Billy in fact, had a paperweight in his office which was a blob of polished amber with three ladybugs embedded in it.
&#x27;Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">46</em><br/><span>Tralfamadorians on free will</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&#x27;How-how did I get here?&#x27;
&#x27;It would take another Earthling to explain it to you. Earthlings are the great explainers, explaining why this event is structured as it is, telling how other events may be achieved or avoided. I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is. Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I&#x27;ve said before, bugs in amber.&#x27;
&#x27;You sound to me as though you don&#x27;t believe in free will,&#x27; said Billy Pilgrim.
&#x27;If I hadn&#x27;t spent so much time studying Earthlings,&#x27; said the Tralfamadorian, &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t have any idea what was meant by &quot;free will.&quot; I&#x27;ve visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe, and I have studied reports on one hundred more. Only on Earth is there any talk of free will.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">46</em><br/><span>Reality from the Tralfamadorian perspective</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy Pilgrim says that the Universe does not look like a lot of bright little dots to the creatures from Tralfamadore. The creatures can see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti. And Tralfamadorians don&#x27;t see human beings as two-legged creatures, either. They see them as great millipedes with babies&#x27; legs at one end and old people&#x27;s legs at the other, says Billy Pilgrim.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">47</em><br/><span>Novels on Tralfamadore</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&#x27;There are no telegrams on Tralfamadore. But you&#x27;re right: each clump of-symbols is a brief, urgent message describing a situation, a scene. We Tralfamadorians read them all at once, not one after the other. There isn&#x27;t any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">53</em><br/><span>Science fiction, lies, and life</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>So they were trying to re-invent themselves and their universe. Science fiction was a big help.
Rosewater said an interesting thing to Billy one time about a book that wasn&#x27;t science fiction. He said that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov, by Feodor Dostoevsky. &#x27;But that isn&#x27;t enough any more.&#x27; said Rosewater.
Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist, &#x27;I think you guys are going to have to come up with a lot of wonderful new lies, or people just aren&#x27;t going to want to go on living.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">57</em><br/><span>The alternate title in the horrors of war</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>And he said,&#x27;You know we&#x27;ve had to imagine the war here, and we have imagined that it was being fought by aging men like ourselves. We had forgotten that wars were fought by babies. When I saw those freshly shaved faces, it was a shock &quot;My God, my God-&quot; I said to myself. &quot;It&#x27;s the Children&#x27;s Crusade.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">58</em><br/><span>The Gospel from Outer Space</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Rosewater was on the next bed, reading, and Billy drew him into the conversation, asked him what he was reading this time.
So Rosewater told him. It was The Gospel from Outer Space, by Kilgore Trout. It was about a visitor from outer space, shaped very much like a Tralfamadorian by the way. The visitor from outer space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to the lowest of the low.
But the Gospels actually taught this: Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isn&#x27;t well connected. So it goes.
The flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didn&#x27;t look like much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe. Readers understood that, so, when they came to the crucifixion, they naturally thought, and Rosewater read out loud again:
Oh, boy-they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time! And that thought had a brother: &#x27;There are right people to lynch .&#x27; Who? People not well connected. So it goes.
The visitor from outer space made a gift to Earth of a new Gospel. In it, Jesus really was a nobody, and a pain in the neck to a lot of people with better connections than he had. He still got to say all the lovely and puzzling things he said in the otherGospels.
So the people amused themselves one day by nailing him to a cross and planting the cross in the ground. There couldn&#x27;t possibly be any repercussions, the lynchers thought. The reader would have to think that, too, since the new Gospel hammered home again and again what a nobody Jesus was. And then, just before the nobody died, the heavens opened up, and there was thunder and lightning.
The voice of God came crashing down. He told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son giving him the full powers and privileges of The Son of the Creator of the Universe throughout all eternity. God said this From this moment on, He will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections!
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">61</em><br/><span>Billy&#x27;s plea for peace</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>But the subject of war never came up until Billy brought it up himself. Somebody in the zoo crowd asked him through the lecturer what the most valuable thing he had learned on Tralfamadore was so far, and Billy replied, &#x27;How the inhabitants of a whole planet can live in peace. As you know, I am from a planet that has been engaged in senseless slaughter since the beginning of time. I myself have seen the bodies of schoolgirls who were boiled alive in a water tower by my own countrymen, who were proud of fighting pure evil at the time. &#x27; This was true. Billy saw the boiled bodies in Dresden. &#x27;And I have lit my way in a prison at night with candles from the fat of human beings who were butchered by the brothers and fathers of those school girls who were boiled. Earthlings must be the terrors of the Universe! If other planets aren&#x27;t now in danger from Earth, they soon will be. So tell me the secret so I can take it back to Earth and save us all: How can a planet live at peace?
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">62</em><br/><span>Perspectives of Tralfamadorians, perspectives of humans</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>One of the biggest moral bombshells handed to Billy by the Tralfamadorians, incidentally, had to do with sex on Earth. They said their flying-saucer crews had identified no fewer than seven sexes on Earth, each essential to reproduction. Again: Billy couldn&#x27;t possibly imagine what five of those seven sexes had to do with the making of a baby, since they were sexually active only in the fourth dimension.
The Tralfamadorians tried to give Billy clues that would help him imagine sex in the invisible dimension. They told him that there could be no Earthling babies without male homosexuals. There could be babies without female homosexuals. There couldn&#x27;t be babies without women over sixty-five years old. There could be babies without men over sixty-five. There couldn&#x27;t be babies without other babies who had lived an hour or less after birth. And so on.
It was gibberish to Billy.
There was a lot that Billy said that was gibberish to the Tralfamadorians, too. They couldn&#x27;t imagine what time looked like to him. Billy had given up on explaining that. The guide outside had to explain as best he could.
The guide invited the crowd to imagine that they were looking across a desert at a mountain range on a day that was twinkling bright and clear. They could look at a peak or a bird or a cloud, at a stone right in front of them, or even down into a canyon behind them. But among them was this poor Earthling, and his head was encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off. There was only one eyehole through which he could look, and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe.
This was only the beginning of Billy&#x27;s miseries in the metaphor. He was also strapped to a steel lattice which was bolted to a flatcar on rails, And there was no way he could turn his head or touch the pipe. The far end of the piperested on a bi-pod which was also bolted to the flatcar. All Billy could see was the dot at the end of the pipe. He didn&#x27;t know he was on a flatcar, didn&#x27;t even know there was anything peculiar about his situation.
The flatcar sometimes crept, sometimes went extremely fast, often stopped-went uphill, downhill, around curves, along straightaways. Whatever poor Billy saw through the pipe, he had no choice but to say to himself, &#x27;That&#x27;s life.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">62</em><br/><span>The Tralfamadorian&#x27;s response</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy felt that he had spoken soaringly. He was baffled when he saw the Tralfamadorians close their little hands on their eyes. He knew from past experience what this meant: He was being stupid.
&#x27;Would-would you mind telling me,&#x27; he said to the guide, much deflated, &#x27;what was so stupid about that?&#x27;
&#x27;We know how the Universe ends,&#x27; said the guide, &#x27;and Earth has nothing to do with it, except that it gets wiped out, too.&#x27;
&#x27;How-how does the Universe end?&#x27; said Billy.
&#x27;We blow it up, experimenting with new fuels for our flying saucers. A Tralfamadorian test pilot presses a starter button, and the whole Universe disappears.&#x27; So it goes.
&quot;If You know this,&quot; said Billy, &#x27;isn&#x27;t there some way you can prevent it? Can&#x27;t you keep the pilot from pressing the button?&#x27;
&#x27;He has always pressed it, and he always will . We always let him and we always will let him. The moment is structured that way.&#x27;
&#x27;So,&#x27; said Billy gropingly, I suppose that the idea of, preventing war on Earth is stupid, too. &#x27;
&#x27;Of course.&#x27;
&#x27;But you do have a peaceful planet here.&#x27;
&#x27;Today we do. On other days we have wars as horrible as any you&#x27;ve ever seen or read about. There isn&#x27;t anything we can do about them, so we simply don&#x27;t look at them. We ignore them. We spend eternity looking at pleasant moments-like today at the zoo. Isn&#x27;t this a nice moment?&#x27;
&#x27;Yes.&#x27;
&#x27;That&#x27;s one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: Ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.&#x27;
&#x27;Um,&#x27; said Billy Pilgrim.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">69</em><br/><span>America according to Howard W. Campbell, Jr. (former American turned German war criminal)</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humoristKin Hubbard , &#x27;It ain&#x27;t no disgrace to be poor, but might as well be.&#x27; It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: &#x27;If you&#x27;re so smart, why ain&#x27;t you rich? &#x27; There will also be an American flag no larger than a child&#x27;s hand-glued to a lollipop stick and, flying from the cash register...
Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue, the monograph went on. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times.
Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves. Once this is understood the disagreeable behavior of American enlisted men in German prisons ceases to be a mystery...
A prison administrator dealing with captured American enlisted men for the first time should be warned: Expect no brotherly love, even between brothers. There will be no cohesion between the individuals. Each will be a sulky child who often wishes he were dead.

&#x27;Isn&#x27;t that comforting?&#x27; Billy asked.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">73</em><br/><span>Strange animal magnetism</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy now backed toward it again, looking at it over his shoulder, feeling the magnetism increase. Then he faced it, kneeling on his cot, dared to touch it here and there. He was seeking the exact source of the radiations.
He found two small sources, two lumps an inch apart and hidden in the lining. One was shaped like a pea. The other was shaped like a tiny horseshoe. Billy received a message carried by the radiations. He was told not to find out what the lumps were. He was advised to be content with knowing that they could work miracles for him, provided he did not insist on learning their nature. That was all right with Billy Pilgrim. He was grateful. He was glad.

He swallowed it down in one big gulp. I waited around for ten minutes.&#x27; Now Lazzaro&#x27;s eyes twinkled. &#x27;Blood started coming out of his mouth. He started crying, and he rolled on the ground, as though the knives were on the outside of him instead of on the inside of him. Then he tried to bite out his own insides. I laughed, and I said to him, &quot;You got the right idea now. Tear your own guts out, boy. That&#x27;s me in there with all those knives.&quot;&#x27; So it goes.
&#x27;Anybody ever asks you what the sweetest thing in life is-&#x27;said Lazzaro, &#x27;it&#x27;s revenge.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">75</em><br/><span>Billy&#x27;s death</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Billy is speaking before a capacity audience in a baseball park, which is covered by a geodesic dome. The flag of the country is behind him. It is a Hereford Bull on a field of green. Billy predicts his own death within an hour. He laughed about it, invites the crowd to laugh with him. &#x27;It is high time I was dead..&#x27; he says. &#x27;Many years ago.&#x27; he said, &#x27;a certain man promised to have me killed. He is an old man now, living not far from here. He has read all the publicity associated with my appearance in your fair city. He is insane. Tonight he will keep his promise.&#x27;
There are protests from the crowd.
Billy Pilgrim rebukes them. &#x27;If you protest, if you think that death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I&#x27;ve said.&#x27; Now he closes his speech as he closes every speech with these words: &#x27;Farewell, hello, farewell, hello.&#x27;
There are police around him as he leaves the stage. They are there to protect him from the crush of popularity. No threats on his life have been made since 1945. The police offer to stay with him. They are floridly willing to stand in a circle around him all night, with their zap guns drawn.
&#x27;No, no,&#x27; says Billy serenely. &#x27;It is time for you to go home to your wives and children, and it is time for me to be dead for a little while-and then live again.&#x27; At that moment, Billy&#x27;s high forehead is in the cross hairs of a high-powered laser gun. It is aimed at him from the darkened press box. In the next moment, Billy Pilgrim is dead. So it goes.
So Billy experiences death for a while. It is simply violet light and a hum. There isn&#x27;t anybody else there. Not even Billy Pilgrim is there.

To his back was a vat of syrup that was cooling. The only other person who could see Billy and his spoon was poor old Edgar Derby, who was washing a window outside. The spoon was a tablespoon. Billy thrust it into the vat, turned it around and around, making a gooey lollipop. He thrust it into his mouth.
A moment went by, and then every cell in Billy&#x27;s body shook him with ravenous gratitude and applause.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">85</em><br/><span>Edgar Derby&#x27;s last stand</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Poor old Derby, the doomed high school teacher, lumbered to his feet for what was probably the finest moment in his life. &#x27;Mere are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after an, is that people are discouraged from being characters. But old Derby was a character now. His stance was that of a punch-drunk fighter. His head was down, his fists were out front, waiting for information and battle plan. Derby raised his head, called Campbell a snake. He corrected that. He said that snakes couldn&#x27;t help being snakes, and that Campbell, who could help being what he was, was something much lower than a snake or a rat-or even a blood-filled tick.
Campbell smiled.
Derby spoke movingly of the American form of government, with freedom and justice and opportunities and fair play for all. He said there wasn&#x27;t a man there who wouldn&#x27;t gladly die for those ideals.
He spoke of the brotherhood between the American and the Russian people, and how those two nations were going to crush the disease of Nazism, which wanted to infect the whole world.
The air-raid sirens of Dresden howled.

He had never had an old gang, old sweethearts and pals, but he missed one anyway, as the quartet made slow, agonized experiments with chords-chords intentionally sour, sourer still, unbearably sour, and then a chord that was suffocatingly sweet, and then some sour ones again. Billy had powerful psychosomatic responses to the changing chords. His mouth filled with the taste of lemonade, and his face became grotesque, as though he really were being stretched on the torture engine called the rack...
&#x27;Really-I&#x27;m O.K.&#x27; And he was, too, except that he could find no explanation for why the song had affected him so grotesquely. He had supposed for years that he had no secrets from himself. Here was proof that he had a great big secret somewhere inside, and he could not imagine what it was...
You ever put a full-length mirror on the floor, and then have a dog stand on it?&#x27; Trout asked Billy.
&#x27;No.&#x27;
&#x27;The dog will look down, and all of a sudden he&#x27;ll realize there&#x27;s nothing under him. He thinks he&#x27;s standing on thin air. He&#x27;ll jump a mile.&#x27;
&#x27;He will?&#x27;
That&#x27;s how you looked—as though you all of a sudden realized you were standing on thin air.&#x27;

I learned that on Tralfamadore.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">105</em><br/><span>A Trout novel—The Big Board</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>These fictitious people in the zoo had a big board supposedly showing stock market, quotations and commodity prices along one wall of their habitat, and a news ticker, and a telephone that was supposedly connected to a brokerage on Earth. The creatures on Zircon-212 told their captives that they had invested a million dollars for them back on Earth, and that it was up to the captives to manage it so that they would be fabulously wealthy when they returned to Earth.
The telephone and the big board and the ticker were all fakes, of-course. They were simply stimulants to make the Earthlings perform vividly for the crowds at the zoo--to make them jump up and down and cheer, or gloat, or sulk, or tear their hair, to be scared shitless or to feel as contented as babies in their mothers&#x27; arms.
The Earthlings did very well on paper. That was part of the rigging, of course. And religion got mixed up in it, too. The news ticker reminded them that the President of the United States had declared National Prayer Week, and that everybody should pray. The Earthlings had had a bad week on the market before that. They had lost a small fortune in olive oil futures. So they gave praying a whirl. It worked. Olive oil went up.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">106</em><br/><span>Irony by Kilgore Trout</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Another Kilgore Trout book there in the window was about a man who built a time machine so he could go back and see Jesus. It worked, and he saw Jesus when Jesus was only twelve years old. Jesus was learning the carpentry trade from his father.
Two Roman soldiers came into the shop with a mechanical drawing on papyrus of a device they wanted built by sunrise the next morning. It was a cross to be used in the execution of a rabble-rouser. Jesus and his father built it. They were glad to have the work. And the rabble-rouser was executed on it.
So it goes...
The time-traveler in the book went back to Bible times to find out one thing in particular: Whether or not Jesus had really died on the cross, or whether he had been taken down while still alive, whether he had really gone on living. The hero had a stethoscope along.
Billy skipped to the end of the book, where the hero mingled with the people who were taking Jesus down from the cross. The time-traveler was the first one up the ladder, dressed in clothes of the period, and he leaned close to Jesus so people couldn&#x27;t see him use the stethoscope, and he listened.
There wasn&#x27;t a sound inside the emaciated chest cavity. The Son of God was as dead as a doornail.
So it goes.
