They called him a comical genius and carried his stories carefully home, and they wondered at how the stories spilled out on the way, for they never sounded the same repeated in their own kitchens.

The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And there is one thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up again; they never quite shine. And the child&#x27;s world is never quite whole again. It is an aching king of growing.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">20</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Young Adam was always an obedient child. Something in him shrank from violence, from contention, from the silent shrieking tensions that can rip at a house. He contributed to the quiet he wished for by offering no violence, no contention, and to do this he had to retire into secretness, since there is some violence in everyone. He covered his life with a veil of vagueness, while behind his quiet eyes a rich full life went on. This did not protect him from assault but it allowed him an immunity.

You&#x27;ll know no word the others can&#x27;t say. And you&#x27;ll do things because the others do them. You&#x27;ll feel the danger in any difference whatever — a danger to the whole crowd of like-thinking, like-acting men.&quot;... But there are others who go down, submerge in the common slough, and then rise more themselves than they were, because — because they have lost a littleness of vanity and have gained all the gold of the company and the regiment. If you can go down so low, you will be able to rise higher than you can conceive, and you will know a holy joy, a companionship almost like that of a heavenly company of angels.

Maybe it&#x27;s good and maybe it&#x27;s bad to answer it. You&#x27;re not clever. You don&#x27;t know what you want. You have no proper fierceness. You let other people walk over you. Sometimes I think you&#x27;re a weakling who will never amount to a dog turd. Does that answer your question? I love you better. I always have. This may be a bad thing to tell you, but it&#x27;s true. I love you better. Else why would I have given myself the trouble of hurting you? Now shut your mouth and go to your supper.

To inflict any hurt on anything for any purpose became inimical to him. He became obsessed with this emotion, for such it surely was, until it blotted out any possible thinking in its area.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">57</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>People are felt rather than seen after the first few moments. During his second sentence on the roads of Florida, Adam reduced his personality to a minus. He caused no stir, put out no vibration, became as nearly invisible as it is possible to be. And when the guards could not feel him, they were not afraid of him.

You were. Maybe — maybe love makes you suspicious and doubting. Is it true that when you love a woman you are never sure — never sure of her because you aren&#x27;t sure of yourself? I can see it pretty clearly. I can see how you loved him and what it did to you. I did not love him. Maybe he loved me. He tested me and hurt me and punished me and finally he sent me out like a sacrifice, maybe to make up for something. But he did not love you, and so he had faith in you. Maybe — why, maybe it&#x27;s a kind of reverse.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">71</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some are born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places. They are accidents and no one&#x27;s fault, as used to be thought. Once they were considered the visible punishments for concealed sins.  And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born? The face and body may be perfect, but if a twisted gene or a malformed egg can produce physical monsters, may not the same process produce a malformed soul?  Monsters are variations from the accepted normal to a greater or less degree. As a child may be born without an arm, so one may be born without kindness or the potential of conscience... To a man born without conscience, a soul-stricken man must seem ridiculous. To a criminal, honesty is foolish. You must not forget that a monster is only a variation, and that to a monster the norm is monstrous.

Most children abhor difference. They want to look, talk, dress, and act exactly like all of the others...  Cathy had none of this. She never conformed in dress or conduct. She wore whatever she wanted to. The result was that quite often other children imitated her.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">79</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>But Cathy did not forget her lies, and she developed the most effective method of lying. She stayed close enough to the truth so that one could never be sure. She knew two other methods also — either to interlard her lies with truth or to tell a truth as though it were a lie. If one is accused of a lie and it turns out to be the truth, there is a backlog that will last a long time and protect a number of untruths.

As a matter of business he had learned so much about woman that he did not trust one for a second. And since he deeply loved Catherine and love requires trust, he was torn to quivering fragments by his emotion.

He felt warmth for his brother you can only feel for someone who is not perfect and therefore no target for your hatred.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">130</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Sometimes a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man. It happens to nearly everyone. You can feel it growing or preparing like a fuse burning toward dynamite. It is a feeling in the stomach, a delight of the nerves, of the forearms. The skin tastes the air, and every deep-drawn breath is sweet... And I guess a man&#x27;s importance in the world can be measured by the quality and number of his glories. It is a lonely thing but it relates us to the world. It is the mother of all creativeness, and it sets each man separate from all other men.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">131</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Our species is the only creative species, and it has only one creative instrument, the individual mind and spirit of a man. Nothing was ever created by two men. There are no good collaborations, whether in music, in art, in poetry, in mathematics, in philosophy. Once the miracle of creation has taken place, the group can build and extend it, but the group never invents anything. The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man... And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about. I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind, for that is one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system. Surely I can understand this, and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts. If the glory can be killed, we are lost.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">132</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that Cathy was what I have called a monster. Perhaps we can&#x27;t understand Cathy, but on the other hand we are capable of many things in all directions, of great virtues and great sins. And who in his mind has not probed the black water?... It would be absurd if we did not understand both angels and devils, since we invented them.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">161</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;Pidgin they expect, and pidgin they&#x27;ll listen to. But English from me they don&#x27;t listen to, and so they don&#x27;t understand it.&quot; &quot;Can that be possible? How do I understand you?&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m talking to you. You are one of the rare people who can separate your observation from your preconception. You see what is, where most people see what they expect.&quot; ...  &quot;I think it&#x27;s a matter of what is expected. You look at a man&#x27;s eyes, you see that he expects pidgin and a shuffle, so you speak pidgin and shuffle.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">182</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>When I said Cathy was a monster it seemed to me that it was so. Now I have bent close with a glass over the small print of her and reread the footnotes, and I wonder if it was true. The trouble is that since we cannot know what she wanted, we will never know whether or not she got it... Who knows but that she tried to tell someone or everyone what she was like and could not, for the lack of a common language. Her life may have been her language, formal, developed, indecipherable. It is easy to say she was bad, but there is little meaning unless we know why.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">187</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;You know when a man lives alone as much as I do, his mind can go off on an irrational tangent just because his social world is out of kilter.&quot;

</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">268</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;I think this is the best-known story in the world because it is everybody&#x27;s story. I think it is the symbol story of the human soul... The greatest terror a child can have is that he is not loved, and rejection is the hell he fears... and with rejection comes anger, and with anger some kind of crime in revenge for the rejection, and with the crime guilt — and there is the story of mankind... It is all there — the start, the beginning. One child, refused the love he craves, kicks the cat and hides his secret guilt; and another steals so that money will make him loved; and a third conquers the world — and always the guilt and revenge and more guilt... Therefore I think this old and terrible story is important because it is a chart of the soul — the secret, rejected, guilty soul.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">268</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;It&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t courage... There you have the difference between greatness and mediocrity. It&#x27;s not an uncommon disease. But it&#x27;s nice for a mediocre man to know that greatness must be the loneliest state in the world.&quot; ... &quot;On one side you have warmth and companionship and sweet understanding, and on the other — cold, lonely greatness.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">268</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;And here I make a rule — a great and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last.

His world did not have death as a member. He, and all around him, was immortal. When real death came it was an outrage, a denial of the immortality he deeply felt, and the one crack in his wall caused the whole structure to crash.

And while I tell you, I am myself sifting my memories, the way men pan the dirt under a barroom floor for the bits of gold dust that fall between the cracks. It&#x27;s small mining — small mining. You&#x27;re too young a man to be panning memories, Adam. You should be getting yourself some new ones, so that the mining will be richer when you come to age.&quot;

The King James translation makes a promise in &#x27;Thou shalt,&#x27; meaning that men will surely triumph over sin. But the Hebrew word, the word timshel — &#x27;Thou mayest&#x27; — that gives a choice. It might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open.  That throws it right back on a man. For if &#x27;Thou mayest&#x27; — it is also true that &#x27;Thou mayest not.&#x27; Don&#x27;t you see?&quot; ...  &quot;Now, there are many millions in their sects and churches who feel the order, &#x27;Do thou,&#x27; and throw their weight into obedience. And there are millions more who feel predestination in &#x27;Thou shalt.&#x27; Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be. But &#x27;Thou mayest&#x27;! Why, that makes a man great, that gives him stature with the gods, for in his weakness and his filth and his murder of his brother he has still the great choice. He can choose his course and fight through it and win.&quot; ...  &quot;It is easy out of laziness, out of weakness, to throw oneself into the lap of deity, saying, &#x27;I couldn&#x27;t help it; the way was set.&quot; But think of the glory of the choice! That makes a man a man. A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey. There&#x27;s no godliness there. And do you know, those old gentlemen who were sliding gently down to death are too interested to die now?&quot; ...  &quot;Confucius tells men how they should live to have good and successful lives. But this — this is a ladder to climb to the stars.&quot; &quot;This is not theology. I have no bent toward gods. But I have a new love for that glittering instrument, the human soul. It is a lovely and unique thing in the universe.  It is always attacked and never destroyed — because &#x27;Thou mayest.&#x27;&quot;

Can you move your lips? Make your lips form his name.&quot; Adam looked up with sick weariness. His lips parted and failed and tried again. Then his lungs filled. He expelled the air and his lips combed the rushing sigh. His whispered word seemed to hang in the air: &quot;Timshel!&quot; His eyes closed and he slept.
