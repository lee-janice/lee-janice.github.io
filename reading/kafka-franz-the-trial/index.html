</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">8</em><br/><span>Dialogue from guard to K.</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>We&#x27;re lowly employees who can barely make our way through such documents,  and whose only role in your affair is to stand guard over you ten hours a day  and get paid for it. That&#x27;s all we are, but we&#x27;re smart enough to realize that  before ordering such an arrest the higher authorities who employ us inform  themselves in great detail about the person they&#x27;re arresting and the grounds  for the arrest. There&#x27;s been no mistake.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">31</em><br/><span>Dialogue from K. to Fräulein Bürstner</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>The inspector cries out as if he has to wake me up, practically shouting;  unfortunately I&#x27;ll have to shout too, to show you how it was; all he shouts  is his name, by the way.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">33</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>...before falling asleep he reflected briefly on his conduct: he was pleased  with it, but was surprised that he didn&#x27;t feel even more pleased; he was seriously  concerned on Fräulein Bürstner&#x27;s behalf because of the captain.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">41</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>He regretted his plan, which had at first seemed so practical. As he was approaching  the fifth floor he decided to give up the search, took his leave from a friendly  young worker who wanted to lead him further upward, and started back down. But then,  annoyed once more by the futility of the whole enterprise, he returned and knocked at  the first door on the fifth floor.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">42</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>K. let him lead the way; it turned out that there was indeed a narrow path free through  the swirling crowd, one that possibly divided two parties; this possibility was further  supported by the fact that K. saw scarcely a face turned toward him in the closest rows  on his left and right, but merely the backs of people addressing their words and gestures  solely to those in their own party.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">45</em><br/><span>K. addressing the assembly</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Your question, Your Honor, about my being a house painter -- and you weren&#x27;t really asking  at all, you were telling me outright -- is characteristic of the way these entire proceedings  against me are being conducted. You may object that these aren&#x27;t proceedings at all, and you&#x27;re  certainly right there, they are only proceedings if I recognize them as such... what has  happened to me is merely a single case and as such of no particular consequence, since I  don&#x27;t take it very seriously, but it is typical of the proceedings being brought against  many people. I speak for them, not myself... The examining magistrate here beside me has  just given one of you a secret signal. So there are those among you who are being directed  from up here... there can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this court, and  in my case, behind the arrest and today&#x27;s inquiry, there exists an extensive organization.  An organization that not only engages corrupt guards, inane inspectors, and examining magistrates  who are at best mediocre, but that supports as well a system of judges of all ranks, including  the highest, with their inevitable innumerable entourage of assistants, scribes, gendarmes, and  other aides, perhaps even hangmen, I won&#x27;t shy away from the word... So!... I see you&#x27;re all  officials, you&#x27;re the corrupt band I was speaking about; you&#x27;ve crowded in here to listen and  snoop, you&#x27;ve formed apparent parties and had one side applaud to test me, you wanted to learn  how to lead innocent men astray.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">49</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray">The blinding white glare in this quote parallels Camus&#x27; descriptions of overbearing, oppressive light in The Stranger:  &quot;the glare from the sky was unbearable&quot;, Meursault being &quot;almost blinded by the glaze of light,&quot; and his &quot;trial opened with the sun glaring outside.&quot; Slightly uncanny...
</span></span><p>The two parties, which had appeared to hold such contrasting opinions before, mingled with one  another, some people pointing their fingers at K., others at the examining magistrate. The  foglike haze in the room was extremely annoying, even preventing any closer observation of  those standing further away... K. was interrupted by a shriek from the other end of the hall;  he shaded his eyes so that he could see, for the dull daylight had turned the haze into a  blinding white glare.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">52</em><br/><span>Dialogue from examining magistrate to K.</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;I just wanted to draw your attention to the fact,&quot; said the examining magistrate,  &quot;that you have today deprived yourself -- although you can&#x27;t yet have realized it --  the advantage that an interrogation offers to the arrested man in each case.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">57</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray">Not the quote of most significance, but I wanted to research what the meaning behind this book  title was. When I looked it up a while ago, there was some strange connection to the tale of Hans and Gretel,  but I didn&#x27;t come to a conclusive or satisfactory answer.
</span></span><p>K. didn&#x27;t leaf through any further, but simply opened to the frontispiece of the  second book, a novel entitled *The Torments Grete Suffered at the Hands of Her Husband Hans*.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">66</em><br/><span>Dialogue from the court usher to K. regarding his wife</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;You see,&quot; said the court usher, &quot;they&#x27;re always taking her away from me. Today is Sunday, and I have no  official duties, but just to get me out of the way, they send me off with a message that&#x27;s meaningless anyway.  And infact I&#x27;m not sent far, so that thhe hope remains that if I really hurry, I might get back in time.  I run as fast as I can to the office they&#x27;ve sent me to... but the student has moved even faster than I have...  If I weren&#x27;t so dependent on them, I would have long since crushed the student against this wall.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">73</em><br/><span>K. has an attack in the court offices</span><br/><span style="color:gray">It&#x27;s an intriguing depiction of anxiety, panic attacks, and mental spiraling.  The last part reminds me of learned helplessness.
</span></span><p>&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you like to sit down?&quot; K. sat down immediately and propped his elbows on the arms of the chair  for better support. &quot;You&#x27;re a little dizzy, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; she asked him... &quot;Don&#x27;t worry,&quot; she said, &quot;there&#x27;s  nothing unusual about that here, almost everyone has an attack like this the first time.&quot; ... But K. didn&#x27;t want to  go to the infirmary; that was precisely what he wanted to avoid, being led farther on, for the farther he went,  the worse things would get... in reality it would have done him a good deal to sit down; he felt seasick.  He thought he was on a ship, rolling in heavy seas. It seemed to him that the waters were pounding against  the wooden walls, there was a roar from the depths of the hallway like the sound of breaking waves, the hallway  seemed to pitch and roll, lifting and lowering the waiting clients on both sides... He realized at last that  they were speaking to him, but he couldn&#x27;t understand them; he heard only the noise that filled everything,  through which a steady, high-pitched sound like a siren seemed to emerge... he heard beside him: &quot;First he  wants to leave, then you can tell him a hundred times that this is the exit and he doesn&#x27;t move.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">82</em><br/><span>Dialogue from the guards to K. whilst they are flogged</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;Sir,&quot; said Willem, while Franz apparently tried to seek safety behind him from the third man, &quot;if you knew
 how poorly we&#x27;re paid, you&#x27;d judge us more kindly. I have a family to feed and Franz here wants to get married, 
 you try to make money however you can, just working isn&#x27;t enough, nno matter how hard you try... of course, 
 it was wrong, but it&#x27;s a tradition that the undergarments belong to the guards, it&#x27;s always been that way, believe me;&quot;...
 &quot;you have to admit we did a good job from the authorities&#x27; point of view-wwe had prospects for advancement and 
 would soon have been floggers ourselves, like him...&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">82</em><br/><span>Dialogue from K. to the flogger</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;Because I don&#x27;t even consider them guilty; it&#x27;s the organization that&#x27;s guilty, it&#x27;s the high officials who are guilty.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">85</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>It tormented him that he had been unable to prevent the flogging, but it wasn&#x27;t his fault;...  No one could really demand such a sacrifice of him.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">87</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray">This is the first instance of something &quot;extraordinary&quot; or truly unrealistic happening in The Trial. It also reminds me of what happens when we try to mentally repress something: it doesn&#x27;t disappear or go away. It comes back just as before, oft with a vengeance.
</span></span><p>As he passed by the junk room again on his way home, he opened the door as if by habit. What he saw,  in place of the expected darkness, bewildered him completely. Everything was unchanged, just as he  had found it the previous evening when he opened the dor. The printed forms and ink bottles just  beyond the threshold, the flogger with the rod, the guards, still completely clothed, the candle on  the shelf, and the guards began to wail, crying out: &quot;Sir!&quot;  K. slammed the door shut at once and  pounded his fists against it, as if to close it more tightly... he headed for home, tired and with  his mind a blank.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">106</em><br/><span>Dialogue from Leni to K.</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;Please don&#x27;t ask for names, but stop making that mistake, don&#x27;t be so stubborn; you can&#x27;t defend  yourself against this court, all you can do is confess. Confess the first chance you get. That&#x27;s  the only chance you have to escape, the only one.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">111</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray">Explanation does not excuse one&#x27;s actions.
</span></span><p>He had often considered whether it might not be advisable to prepare a written defense and submit  it to the court. In it he would offer a brief overview of his life, and for each event of any  particular importance, explain why he had acted as he did, whether in his present judgment this  course of action deserved approval or censure, and what reasons he could advance for the one or  the other.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">119</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>The only proper approach is to learn to accept existing conditions. Even if it were possible  to improve specific details-which, however, is merely an absurd superstition-one would have  at best achieved something for future cases, while in the process damaging oneself immeasurably  by having attracted the attention of an always vengeful bureaucracy. Just don&#x27;t attract attention!  Keep calm, no matter how much it seems counter to good sense. Try to realize that this vast  judicial organism remains, so to speak, inn a state of eternal equilibrium, and that if you  change something on your own where you are, you can cut the ground out from your own feet and  fall, while the vast organism easily compensates for the minor disturbance at some other  spot-after all, everything is interconnected-and remains unchanged, if not, which is likely,  even more resolute, more vigilant, more severe, more malicious.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">125</em><br/><span>K. regarding his trial</span><br/><span style="color:gray">Interesting to note all of the conflicting opinions on what K. should do about his trial.
</span></span><p>Above all, if he wanted to get anywhere, he had to reject the notion of any possible guilt  right from the start. There was no guilt.

But aren&#x27;t those wings on  her heels, and isn&#x27;t she in motion? &quot;Yes, said the painter, &quot;I&#x27;m commissioned to do it  that way, it&#x27;s actually Justice and the goddess of Victory in one.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s a poor combination,&quot;  said K. smiling, &quot;Justice must remain at rest, otherwise the scales sway and no just judgment is possible.&quot;... in this brightness the figure seemed to stand out strikingly; now it scarcely recalled the goddess of Justice,  or even that of Victory, now it looked just like the goddess of the Hunt.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">153</em><br/><span>Dialogue between the painter and K.</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>...he said, as quietly as the painter: &quot;I think you&#x27;re contradicting yourself.&quot; &quot;How?&quot; the painter  asked patiently and leaned back with a smile. This smile made K. feel as if he were trying to  reveal contradictions not so much in the words of the painter as in the legal process itself.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">154</em><br/><span>Dialogue between the painter and K.</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;Such acquittals are said to have occurred, of course,&quot; said the painter. &quot;But that&#x27;s  extremely difficult to determine. The final verdicts of the court are not published, and  not even the judges have access to them; thus only legends remain about ancient court cases.  These tell of actual acquittals, of course, even in a majority of cases; you can believe  them, but they can&#x27;t be proved true. Nevertheless they shouldn&#x27;t be entirely ignored;  they surely contain a certain degree of truth, and they are very beautiful; I myself have  painted a few pictures based on such legends.&quot;

With numerous reservations that&#x27;s true of course, but it&#x27;s equally  true that your anxiety disgusts me and that I see in it a lack of necessary faith.

He was leaning on his sword, which he had thrust into the bare  earth-only a few blades of grass sprang up here and there-before him. He seemed to be gazing  attentively at a scene taking place directly in front of him... he discovered it was a conventional  depiction of the entombment of Christ, and moreover a fairly recent one.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">211</em><br/><span>K. upon being called by the priest</span><br/><span style="color:gray">This thought only comes to me since I just finished Chapter 9 in Gödel, Escher, Bach, but this  reminds me of the kōan that Hofstader comments on: Goso said: &quot;When a buffalo goes out of his  enclosure to the edge of the abyss, his horns and his head and his hoofs all pass through,  but why can&#x27;t the tail also pass?&quot; And Mumon&#x27;s poem: If the buffalo runs, he will fall into  the trench; // If he returns, he will be butchered. // That little tail // Is a very strange thing.
</span></span><p>K. hesitated and stared at the floor. At the moment he was still free; he could walk on and  leave through one of the three small dark wooden doors not far from him. That would mean he  hadn&#x27;t understood or that he had indeed understood but couldn&#x27;t be bothered to respond. But  if he turned around he was caught, for then he would have confessed that he understood quite  well, that he really was the person named, and that he was prepared to obey.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">213</em><br/><span>Dialogue between K. and the priest</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;But I&#x27;m not guilty,&quot; said K. &quot;It&#x27;s a mistake. How can any person in general be guilty? We&#x27;re  human after all, each and every one of us.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">214</em><br/><span>Dialogue between K. and the priest</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Then the priest screamed down at K.: &quot;Can&#x27;t you see two steps in front of you?&quot; It was a cry  of rage, but at the same time it was the cry of someone who, seeing a man falling, shouts  out in shock, involuntarily, without thinking.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">214</em><br/><span>K. regarding the priest</span><br/><span style="color:gray">Reminds me of meta-ness, jumping out of the system, Gödel, Escher, Bach.
</span></span><p>Nevertheless, the priest&#x27;s good intentions seemed clear to K.; it was not impossible that  they might come to terms if he would come down, it was not impossible that he might  receive some form of decisive and acceptable advice from him, something that might  show him, for example, not how to influence the trial, but how to break out of it,  how to get around it, how to live outside the trial.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">215</em><br/><span>Dialogue from the priest to K.</span><br/><span style="color:gray">Reminds me of infinite regress, G.O.D. Over Djinn, and Sisyphus.
</span></span><p>&quot;You&#x27;re deceiving yourself about the court,&quot; said the priest, &quot;in the introductory texts  to the Law it says of this deception: Before the Law stands a doorkeeper. A man from  the country comes to this doorkeeper and requests admittance to the Law. But the doorkeeper  says that he can&#x27;t grant him admittance now. The man thinks it over and then asks if  he&#x27;ll be allowed to enter later. &#x27;It&#x27;s possible,&#x27; says the doorkeeper, &#x27;but not now.&#x27;  Since the gate to the Law stands open as always, and the doorkeeper steps aside,  the man bends down to look through the gate into the interior. WWhen the doorkeeper  sees this he laughs and says, &#x27;If you&#x27;re so drawn to it, go ahead and try to enter,  even though I&#x27;ve forbidden it. But bear this in mind: I&#x27;m powerful. And I&#x27;m only the  lowest doorkeeper. From hall to hall, however, stand doorkeepers each more powerful than  the one before. The mere sight of the third is more than even I can bear.&#x27;... he decides  he would prefer to wait until he receives permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a  stool and lets him sit down at the side of the door. He sits there for days and years...  Finally his eyes grow dim and he no longer knows whether it&#x27;s really getting darker around  him or if his eyes are merely deceiving him. And yet in the darkness he now sees a radiance  that streams forth inextinguishably from the door of the Law. He doesn&#x27;t have much longer  to live now. Before he dies, everything he has experienced over the years coalesces in his  mind into a single question he has never asked the doorkeeper... &#x27;Everyone strives to reach  the Law,&#x27; says the man, &#x27;how does it happen, then, that in all these years no one but me  has requested admittance. The doorkeeper sees that the man is nearing his end, and in order  to reach his failing hearing, he roars at him: &#x27;No one else could gain admittance here,  because this entrance was meant solely for you. I&#x27;m going to go and shut it now.&#x27;&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">219</em><br/><span>The priest on the texts of the Law</span><br/><span style="color:gray">This reminds me of the kōan in Gödel, Escher, Bach: Shuzan held out his short staff and  said: &quot;If you call this a short staff, you oppose its reality. If you do not call it a  short staff, you ignore the fact. Now what do you wish to call this?&quot;
</span></span><p>The commentators tell us: the correct understanding of a matter and misunderstanding  the matter are not mutually exclusive.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">220</em><br/><span>The priest on the commentary on the Law</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;Don&#x27;t misunderstand me,&quot; said the priest, &quot;I&#x27;m just pointing out the various opinions  that exist on the matter. You mustn&#x27;t pay too much attention to opinions. The text is  immutable, and the opinions are often only an expression of despair over it.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">223</em><br/><span>Dialogue between K. and the priest</span><br/><span style="color:gray">This reminds me of the &quot;lies&quot; (paradoxes) that are embedded into any formal system.
</span></span><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t agree with that opinion,&quot; said K., shaking his head, &quot;for if you accept it,  you have to consider everything the doorkeeper says as true. But you&#x27;ve already proved  conclusively that that&#x27;s not possible.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said the priest, &quot;you don&#x27;t have to  consider everything true, you just have to consider it necessary.&quot; &quot;A depressing  opinion,&quot; said K. &quot;Lies are made into a universal system.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">223</em><br/><span>Dialogue between K. and the priest</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;First you must see who I am,&quot; said the priest. &quot;You&#x27;re the prison chaplain,&quot; said  K. and drew nearer to the priest; his immediate return to the bank wasn&#x27;t so important  as he&#x27;d thought, he could easily stay here longer. &quot;Therefore I belong to the court,&quot;  said the priest. &quot;Why should I want something from you. The court wants nothing from  you. It receives you when you come and dismisses you when you go.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">228</em><br/><span>K. while the guards are leading him away</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;The only thing I can do now,&quot; he said to himself, and the way his steps matched  those of the other three confirmed his thoughts, &quot;the only thing I can do now is  keep my mind calm and analytical to the last. I&#x27;ve always wanted to seize the world  with twenty hands, and what&#x27;s more with a motive that was hardly laudable. That was  wrong; do I want to show now that even a yearlong trial could teach me nothing? Do  I want to leave the parting impression that I&#x27;m slow-witted? Shall they say of me  that at the beginning of my trial I wanted to end it, and now, at its end, I want  to begin it again?&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">231</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Then one man opened his frock coat and, from a sheath on a belt that encircled his  vest, drew forth a long, thin, double-edged butcher knife, held it up, and tested  its sharpness in the light. Once more the nauseating courtesies began, one of  them passed the knife across K. to the other, who passed it back over K. K. knew  clearly now that it was his duty to seize the knife as it floated from hand to hand  above him and plunge it into himself. But he didn&#x27;t do so; instead he twisted his  still-free neck and looked about him... His gaze fell upon the top story of the  building adjoining the quarry. Like a light flicking on, the casements of a window  flew open, a human figure, faint and insubstantial at that distance and height,  leaned far out abruptly, and stretched both arms out even further. Who was it?  A friend? A good person? Someone who cared? Someone who wanted to help? Was it just  one person? Was it everyone? Was there still help? Were there objections that had  been forgotten? Of course there were. Logic is no doubt unshakable, but it can&#x27;t  withstand a person who wants to live. Where was the judge he&#x27;d never seen? Where was  the high court he&#x27;d never reached? He raised his hands and spread out all his fingers.
But the hands of one man were right at K.&#x27;s throat, while the other thrust the knife  into his heart and turned it there twice. With failing sight K. saw how the men  drew near his face, leaning cheek-to-cheek to observe the verdict.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">231</em><br/><span>K.&#x27;s end</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;Like a dog!&quot; he said; it seemed as though the shame was to outlive him.
