Of all the creatures in the Universe, only Dwayne was thinking and feeling and worrying and planning and so on. Nobody else knew what pain was. Nobody else had any choices to make. Everybody else was a fully automatic machine, whose purpose was to stimulate Dwayne. Dwayne was a new type of creature being tested by the Creator of the Universe. Only Dwayne Hoover had free will.

It was from an eccentric millionaire, who hired a private detective agency to discover who and where he was. Trout was so invisible that the search cost eighteen thousand dollars. The fan letter reached him in his basement in Cohoes. It was hand- written, and Trout concluded that the writer might be fourteen years old or so. The letter said that Plague on Wheels was the greatest novel in the English language, and that Trout should be President of the United States. Trout read the letter out loud to his parakeet. “Things are looking up, Bill,” he said. “Always knew they would. Get a load of this.” And then he read the letter. There was no indication in the letter that the writer, whose name was Eliot Rosewater, was a grownup, was fabulously well-to-do.

I do know who invented Kilgore Trout. I did. I made him snaggle-toothed. I gave him hair, but I turned it white. I wouldn&#x27;t let him comb it or go to a barber. I made him grow it long and tangled. I gave him the same legs the Creator of the Universe gave to my father when my father was a pitiful old man. They were pale white broomsticks. They were hairless. They were embossed fantastically with varicose veins. And, two months after Trout received his first fan letter, I had him find in his mailbox an invitation to be a speaker at an arts festival in the American Middle West.

He opened the window. But the opening of the window was such an alarming business to the parakeet that he flew back to his cage and hopped inside. Trout closed the door of the cage and latched it. “That&#x27;s the most intelligent use of three wishes I ever heard of,” he told the bird. “You made sure you&#x27;d still have something worth wishing for—to get out of the cage.”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">38</em><br/><span>Trout and his cage</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Trout shook his head. “I&#x27;m not going, Bill.

I&#x27;m going out there to show them what nobody has ever seen at an arts festival before: a representative of all the thousands of artists who devoted their entire lives to a search for truth and beauty—and didn&#x27;t find doodley-squat!”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">53</em><br/><span>Another Trout story</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>As for the story itself, it was entitled “The Dancing Fool.” Like so many Trout stories, it was about a tragic failure to communicate. Here was the plot: A flying saucer creature named Zog arrived on Earth to explain how wars could be prevented and how cancer could be cured. He brought the information from Margo, a planet where the natives conversed by means of farts and tap dancing. Zog landed at night in Connecticut. He had no sooner touched down than he saw a house on fire. He rushed into the house, farting and tap dancing, warning the people about the terrible danger they were in. The head of the house brained Zog with a golfclub.

This was it: What is the purpose of life? Trout plundered his pockets for a pen or pencil. He had an answer to the question. But he had nothing to write with, not even a burnt match. So he left the question unanswered, but here is what he would have written, if he had found anything to write with: To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool. When Trout headed back for his seat in the theater, he played at being the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe. He sent messages by telepathy to the Creator, wherever He was. He reported that the men&#x27;s room had been clean as a whistle. “The carpeting under my feet,” he signaled from the lobby, “is springy and new. I think it must be some miracle fiber. It&#x27;s blue. You know what I mean by blue?” And so on.

You ever see one of His volcanoes or tornadoes or tidal waves? Anybody ever tell you about the Ice Ages he arranges for every half-million years? How about Dutch Elm disease? There&#x27;s a nice conservation measure for you. That&#x27;s God, not man. Just about the time we got our rivers cleaned up, he&#x27;d probably have the whole galaxy go up like a celluloid collar. That&#x27;s what the Star of Bethlehem was, you know.” “What was the Star of Bethlehem?” said the driver. “A whole galaxy going up like a celluloid collar,” said Trout.

But his head no longer sheltered ideas of how things could be and should be on the planet, as opposed to how they really were. There was only one way for the Earth to be, he thought: the way it was. Everything was necessary. He saw an old white woman fishing through a garbage can. That was necessary. He saw a bathtub toy, a little rubber duck, lying on its side on the grating over a storm sewer. It had to be there. And so on.

</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">138</em><br/><span>More on the fabled book</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>The book was in the form of a long letter from The Creator of the Universe to the experimental creature. The Creator congratulated the creature and apologized for all the discomfort he had endured. The Creator invited him to a banquet in his honor in the Empire Room of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, where a black robot named Sammy Davis, Jr., would sing and dance. And the experimental creature wasn&#x27;t killed after the banquet. He was transferred to a virgin planet instead. Living cells were sliced from the palms of his hands, while he was unconscious. The operation didn&#x27;t hurt at all. And then the cells were stirred into a soupy sea on the virgin planet. They would evolve into ever more complicated life forms as the eons went by. Whatever shapes they assumed, they would have free will. Trout didn&#x27;t give the experimental creature a proper name. He simply called him The Man. On the virgin planet, The Man was Adam and the sea was Eve.

He was a messenger and an investigator for the Creator of the Universe. He took the form of an eight hundred pound male cinnamon bear. He was a robot, too, and so was The Creator, according to Kilgore Trout. The bear was attempting to get a line on why The Man did what he did. He would ask, for instance, “Why did you yell, &#x27;Cheese&#x27;?” And The Man would tell him mockingly, “Because I felt like it, you stupid machine.”

That drink was for the person who had created all Wayne&#x27;s misery to date, who could kill him or make him a millionaire or send him back to prison or do whatever he damn pleased with Wayne. That drink was for me.

There in the cocktail lounge, peering out through my leaks at a world of my own invention, I mouthed this word: schizophrenia. The sound and appearance of the word had fascinated me for many years. It sounded and looked to me like a human being sneezing in a blizzard of soapflakes. I did not and do not know for certain that I have that disease. This much I knew and know: I was making myself hideously uncomfortable by not narrowing my attention to details of life which were immediately important, and by refusing to believe what my neighbors believed. I am better now. Word of honor: I am better now.

So, when he looked down into his martini, he was put into a trance by dancing myriads of winking eyes on the surface of his drink. The eyes were beads of lemon oil.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">157</em><br/><span>Vonnegut as the creator of a universe</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I was on a par with the Creator of the Universe there in the dark in the
 cocktail lounge. I shrunk the Universe to a ball exactly one light-year in
 diameter. I had it explode. I had it disperse itself again.
 Ask me a question, any question. How old is the Universe? It is one
 half-second old, but that half-second has lasted one quintillion years
 so far. Who created it? Nobody created it. It has always been here.
 What is time? It is a serpent which eats its tail, like this: (drawing of ouroboros)
 This is the snake which uncoiled itself long enough to offer Eve the
 apple, which looked like this: (drawing of apple)
 What was the apple which Eve and Adam ate? It was the Creator of
 the Universe.
 And so on.
 Symbols can be so beautiful, sometimes.

Here was the thing about my control over the characters I created: I could only guide their movements approximately, since they were such big animals. There was inertia to overcome. It wasn&#x27;t as though I was connected to them by steel wires. It was more as though I was connected to them by stale rubberbands.

</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">163</em><br/><span></span><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>And I made an invisible duplicate on my Formica tabletop of a painting by Rabo Karabekian, entitled The Temptation of Saint Anthony. My duplicate was a miniature of the real thing, and mine was not in color, but I had captured the picture&#x27;s form and the spirit, too. This is what I drew. (drawing of a rectangle with a vertical band on the left half) The original was twenty feet wide and sixteen feet high. The field was Hawaiian Avocado, a green wall paint manufactured by the O&#x27;Hare Paint and Varnish Company in Hellertown, Pennsylvania. The vertical stripe was dayglo orange reflecting tape.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">164</em><br/><span>Unknown purposes of yeast</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Kilgore Trout once wrote a short story which was a dialogue between two pieces of yeast. They were discussing the possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing that they were making champagne.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">164</em><br/><span>What stories do to humans</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I thought Beatrice Keedsler had joined hands with other old-fashioned storytellers to make people believe that life had leading characters, minor characters, significant details, insignificant details, that it had lessons to be learned, tests to be passed, and a beginning, a middle, and an end. As I approached my fiftieth birthday, I had become more and more enraged and mystified by the idiot decisions made by my countrymen. And then I had come suddenly to pity them, for I understood how innocent and natural it was for them to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">165</em><br/><span>Vonnegut&#x27;s approach to storytelling</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Why were so many Americans treated by their government as though their lives were as disposable as paper facial tissues? Because that was the way authors customarily treated bit-part players in their made- up tales. And so on. Once I understood what was making America such a dangerous, unhappy nation of people who had nothing to do with real life, I resolved to shun storytelling. I would write about life. Every person would be exactly as important as any other. All facts would also be given equal weightiness. Nothing would be left out. Let others bring order to chaos. I would bring chaos to order, instead, which I think I have done. If all writers would do that, then perhaps citizens not in the literary trades will understand that there is no order in the world around us, that we must adapt ourselves to the requirements of chaos instead. It is hard to adapt to chaos, but it can be done. I am living proof of that: It can be done.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">171</em><br/><span>Chaos begins</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>And now comes the spiritual climax of this book, for it is at this point that I, the author, am suddenly transformed by what I have done so far. This is why I had gone to Midland City: to be born again. And Chaos announced that it was about to give birth to a new me by putting these words in the mouth of Rabo Karabekian: “What kind of a man would turn his daughter into an outboard motor?” Such a small remark was able to have such thundering consequences because the spiritual matrix of the cocktail lounge was in what I choose to call a pre-earthquake condition. Terrific forces were at work on our souls, but they could do no work, because they balanced one another so nicely. But then a grain of sand crumbled. One force had a sudden advantage over another, and spiritual continents began to shrug and heave.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">171</em><br/><span>To be reborn</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>And my own pre-earthquake condition must be taken into consideration, too, since I was the one who was being reborn. Nobody else in the cocktail lounge was reborn, as far as I know. The rest got their minds changed, some of them, about the value of modern art. As for myself: I had come to the conclusion that there was nothing sacred about myself or about any human being, that we were all machines, doomed to collide and collide and collide. For want of anything better to do, we became fans of collisions. Sometimes I wrote well about collisions, which meant I was a writing machine in good repair. Sometimes I wrote badly, which meant I was a writing machine in bad repair. I no more harbored sacredness than did a Pontiac, a mousetrap, or a South Bend Lathe.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">173</em><br/><span>my God,</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Karabekian slid off his barstool so he could face all those enemies standing up. He certainly surprised me. I expected him to retreat in a hail of olives, maraschino cherries and lemon rinds. But he was majestic up there “Listen—” he said so calmly, “I have read the editorial against my painting in your wonderful newspaper. I have read every word of the hate mail you have been thoughtful enough to send to New York.” This embarrassed people some. “The painting did not exist until I made it,” Karabekian went on. “Now that it does exist, nothing would make me happier than to have it reproduced again and again, and vastly improved upon, by all the five- year-olds in town. I would love for your children to find pleasantly and playfully what it took me many angry years to find. “I now give you my word of honor,” he went on, “that the picture your city owns shows everything about life which truly matters, with nothing left out. It is a picture of the awareness of every animal. It is the immaterial core of every animal—the &#x27;I am&#x27; to which all messages are sent. It is all that is alive in any of us—in a mouse, in a deer, in a cocktail waitress. It is unwavering and pure, no matter what preposterous adventure may befall us. A sacred picture of Saint Anthony alone is one vertical, unwavering band of light. If a cockroach were near him, or a cocktail waitress, the picture would show two such bands of light. Our awareness is all that is alive and maybe sacred in any of us. Everything else about us is dead machinery. “I have just heard from this cocktail waitress here, this vertical band of light, a story about her husband and an idiot who was about to be executed at Shepherdstown. Very well—let a five-year-old paint a sacred interpretation of that encounter. Let that five-year-old strip away the idiocy, the bars, the waiting electric chair, the uniform of the guard, the gun of the guard, the bones and meat of the guard. What is that perfect picture which any five-year-old can paint? Two unwavering bands of light.” Ecstasy bloomed on the barbaric face of Rabo Karabekian. “Citizens of Midland City, I salute you,” he said. “You have given a home to a masterpiece!”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">175</em><br/><span>An unwavering band of light</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>His situation, insofar as he was a machine, was complex, tragic, and laughable. But the sacred part of him, his awareness, remained an unwavering band of light. And this book is being written by a meat machine in cooperation with a machine made of metal and plastic. The plastic, incidentally, is a close relative of the gunk in Sugar Creek. And at the core of the writing meat machine is something sacred, which is an unwavering band of light. At the core of each person who reads this book is a band of unwavering light. My doorbell has just rung in my New York apartment. And I know what I will find when I open my front door: an unwavering band of light. God bless Rabo Karabekian!
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">176</em><br/><span>Man&#x27;s first proclamation</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>It was Trout&#x27;s fantasy that somebody would be outraged by the footprints. This would give him the opportunity to reply grandly, “What is it that offends you so? I am simply using man&#x27;s first printing press. You are reading a bold and universal headline which says, &#x27;I am here, I am here, I am here.&#x27;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">182</em><br/><span>Crossing to the other side</span><br/><span style="color:gray">Like the Allegory of the Cave; like enlightenment; like the hero&#x27;s journey</span></span><p>“Open your eyes!” said Trout. “Would a man nourished by beauty look like this? You have nothing but desolation and desperation here, you say? I bring you more of the same!” “My eyes are open,” said Milo warmly, “and I see exactly what I expect to see. I see a man who is terribly wounded—because he has dared to pass through the fires of truth to the other side, which we have never seen. And then he has come back again—to tell us about the other side.”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">184</em><br/><span>Vonnegut exercises more of his powers as creator</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>As three unwavering bands of light, we were simple and separate and beautiful. As machines, we were flabby bags of ancient plumbing and wiring, of rusty hinges and feeble springs. And our interrelationships were Byzantine. After all, I had created both Dwayne and Trout, and now Trout was about to drive Dwayne into full-blown insanity, and Dwayne would soon bite off the tip of Trout&#x27;s finger.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">185</em><br/><span>Dwayne&#x27;s rapture</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>But then Trout hunched forward involuntarily, buckling the starched shirt bosom, forming it into a parabolic dish. This made a searchlight of the shirt. Its beam was aimed at Dwayne Hoover. The sudden light roused Dwayne from his trance. He thought perhaps he had died. At any rate, something painless and supernatural was going on. Dwayne smiled trustingly at the holy light. He was ready for anything.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">187</em><br/><span>Trout&#x27;s lucidity</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Trout was aware of me, too, what little he could see of me. I made him even more uneasy than Dwayne did. The thing was: Trout was the only character I ever created who had enough imagination to suspect that he might be the creation of another human being. He had spoken of this possibility several times to his parakeet. He had said, for instance, “Honest to God, Bill, the way things are going, all I can think of is that I&#x27;m a character in a book by somebody who wants to write about somebody who suffers all the time.”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">187</em><br/><span>Awareness</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;I wrote again on my tabletop, scrawled the symbols for the interrelationship between matter and energy as it was understood in my day: (drawing of E=Mc^2). It was a flawed equation, as far as I was concerned. There should have been an &#x27;A&#x27; in there somewhere for Awareness—without which the &#x27;E&#x27; and the &#x27;M&#x27; and the &#x27;c,&#x27; which was a mathematical constant; could not exist.&quot;
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">196</em><br/><span>The message</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Dear Sir, poor sir, brave sir:” he read, “You are an experiment by the Creator of the Universe. You are the only creature in the entire Universe who has free will. You are the only one who has to figure out what to do next—and why. Everybody else is a robot, a machine. “Some persons seem to like you, and others seem to hate you, and you must wonder why. They are simply liking machines and hating machines. “You are pooped and demoralized,” read Dwayne. “Why wouldn&#x27;t you be? Of course it is exhausting, having to reason all the time in a universe which wasn&#x27;t meant to be reasonable.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">197</em><br/><span>The message continues</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Dwayne Hoover read on: “You are surrounded by loving machines, hating machines, greedy machines, unselfish machines, brave machines, cowardly machines, truthful machines, lying machines, funny machines, solemn machines,” he read. “Their only purpose is to stir you up in every conceivable way, so the Creator of the Universe can watch your reactions. They can no more feel or reason than grandfather clocks. “The Creator of the Universe would now like to apologize not only for the capricious, jostling companionship he provided during the test, but for the trashy, stinking condition of the planet itself. The Creator programmed robots to abuse it for millions of years, so it would be a poisonous, festering cheese when you got here. Also, He made sure it would be desperately crowded by programming robots, regardless of their living conditions, to crave sexual intercourse and adore infants more than almost anything.”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">198</em><br/><span>The message continues</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>“He also programmed robots to write books and magazines and newspapers for you, and television and radio shows, and stage shows, and films. They wrote songs for you. The Creator of the Universe had them invent hundreds of religions, so you would have plenty to choose among. He had them kill each other by the millions, for this purpose only: that you be amazed. They have committed every possible atrocity and every possible kindness unfeelingly, automatically, inevitably, to get a reaction from Y-O-U.”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">199</em><br/><span>The message continues</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>“Every time you went into the library,” said the book, “the Creator of the Universe held His breath. With such a higgledy-piggledy cultural smorgasbord before you, what would you, with your free will, choose?” “Your parents were fighting machines and self-pitying machines,” said the book. “Your mother was programmed to bawl out your father for being a defective moneymaking machine, and your father was programmed to bawl her out for being a defective housekeeping machine. They were programmed to bawl each other out for being defective loving machines. “Then your father was programmed to stomp out of the house and slam the door. This automatically turned your mother into a weeping machine. And your father would go down to a tavern where he would get drunk with some other drinking machines. Then all the drinking machines would go to a whorehouse and rent fucking machines. And then your father would drag himself home to become an apologizing machine. And your mother would become a very slow forgiving machine.”
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px">199</em><br/><span>Dwayne&#x27;s reception of the message</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Dwayne got to his feet now, having wolfed down tens of thousands of words of such solipsistic whimsey in ten minutes or so. He walked stiffly over to the piano bar. What made him stiff was his awe of his own strength and righteousness. He dared not use his full strength in merely walking, for fear of destroying the new Holiday Inn with footfalls. He did not fear for his own life, Trout&#x27;s book assured him that he had already been killed twenty-three times. On each occasion, the Creator of the Universe had patched him up and got him going again. Dwayne restrained himself in the name of elegance rather than safety. He was going to respond to his new understanding of life with finesse, for an audience of two—himself and his Creator.

I want to make it whole. I want you to feel a wholeness and inner harmony such as I have never allowed you to feel before. I want you to raise your eyes, to look at what I have in my hand.

It is Oriental in its simplicity, but we are Americans, Kilgore, and not Chinamen. We Americans require symbols which are richly colored and three- dimensional and juicy. Most of all, we hunger for symbols which have not been poisoned by great sins our nation has committed, such as slavery and genocide and criminal neglect, or by tinhorn commercial greed and cunning. “Look up, Mr. Trout,” I said, and I waited patiently. “Kilgore—?” The old man looked up, and he had my father&#x27;s wasted face when my father was a widower—when my father was an old old man. He saw that I held an apple in my hand. “I am approaching my fiftieth birthday, Mr. Trout,” I said. “I am cleansing and renewing myself for the very different sorts of years to come. Under similar spiritual conditions, Count Tolstoi freed his serfs. Thomas Jefferson freed his slaves. I am going to set at liberty all the literary characters who have served me so loyally during my writing career.
