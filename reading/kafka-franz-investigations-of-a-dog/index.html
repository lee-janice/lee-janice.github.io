</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>Description of the vision</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>They did not speak, they did not sing, they remained generally silent, almost determinedly silent; but from the empty air they conjured music. Everything was music, the lifting and setting down of their feet, certain turns of the head, their running and their standing still, the positions they took up in relation to one another, the symmetrical patterns which they produced by one dog setting his front paws on the back of another and the rest following suit until the first bore the weight of the other six, or by all lying flat on the ground and going through complicated concerted evolutions; and none made a false move, not even the last dog...
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>Description of the vision</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>But now from my hiding hole I saw, on looking more closely, that it was not so much coolness as the most extreme tension that characterized their performance; these limbs apparently so sure in their movements quivered at every step with a perpetual apprehensive twitching; as if rigid with despair the dogs kept their eyes fixed on one another, and their tongues, whenever the tension weakened for a moment, hung wearily from their jowls. It could not be fear of failure that agitated them so deeply; dogs that could dare and achieve such things had no need to fear that. Then why were they afraid? Who then forced them to do what they were doing?
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>Narrator&#x27;s reaction to the vision</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I rushed about, told my story, asked questions, made accusations and investigations, tried to drag others to the place where all this had happened, and burned to show everybody where I had stood and where the seven had stood, and where and how they had danced and made their music; and if anyone had come with me, instead of shaking me off and laughing at me, I would probably have sacrificed my innocence and tried myself to stand on my hind legs so as to reconstruct the scene clearly.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>The beginning of the investigation</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I began my inquiries with the simplest things; there was no lack of material; it is the actual superabundance, unfortunately, that casts me into despair in my darker hours. I began to inquire into the question what the canine race nourished itself upon. Now that is, if you like, by no means a simple question, of course; it has occupied us since the dawn of time, it is the chief object of all our meditation, countless observations and essays and views on this subject have been published, it has grown into a province of knowledge which in its prodigious compass is not only beyond the comprehension of any single scholar, but of all our scholars collectively, a burden which cannot be borne except by the whole of the dog community, and even then with difficulty and not quite in its totality; for it ever and again crumbles away like a neglected ancestral inheritance and must laboriously be rehabilitated anew -- not to speak at all of the difficulties and almost unfulfillable conditions of my investigation.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>The rule of the dogs</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>In this connection the essence of all knowledge is enough for me, the simple rule with which the mother weans her young ones from her teats and sends them out into the world: &quot;Water the ground as much as you can.&quot; And in this sentence is not almost everything contained?
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>The vital question</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>...my question, however, is the following: &quot;Whence does the earth procure this food?&quot; A question which people in general pretend not to understand, and to which the best answer they can give is: &quot;If you haven&#x27;t enough to eat, we&#x27;ll give you some of ours.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On the drive for knowledge</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>For what is there actually except our own species? To whom but it can one appeal in the wide and empty world? All knowledge, the totality of all questions and all answers, is contained in the dog. If one could but realize this knowledge, if one could but bring it into the light of day, if we dogs would but own that we know infinitely more than we admit to ourselves! ...everything is directed toward achieving an ecstasy, a forgetting and finding again; but the one thing that you long to win above all, the admission of knowledge, remains denied to you. To such prayers, whether silent or loud, the only answers you get, even after you have employed your powers of seduction to the utmost, are vacant stares, averted glances, troubled and veiled eyes. It is much the same as it was when, a mere puppy, I shouted to the dog musicians and they remained silent.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On the collective potential of dogs</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I understand my fellow dogs, am flesh of their flesh, of their miserable, ever-renewed, ever-desirous flesh. But it is not merely flesh and blood that we have in common, but knowledge also, and not only knowledge, but the key to it as well. I do not possess that key except in common with all the others; I cannot grasp it without their help. The hardest bones, containing the richest marrow, can be conquered only by a united crunching of all the teeth of all dogs. ...I want to compel all dogs thus to assemble together, I want the bones to crack open under the pressure of their collective preparedness, and then I want to dismiss them to the ordinary life that they love, while all by myself, quite alone, I lap up the marrow. That sounds monstrous, almost as if I wanted to feed on the marrow, not merely of a bone, but of the whole canine race itself. But it is only a metaphor. The marrow that I am discussing here is no food; on the contrary, it is a poison.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On the work of a lifetime</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Recently I have taken more and more to casting up my life, looking for the decisive, the fundamental, error that I must surely have made; and I cannot find it. And yet I must have made it, for if I had not made it and yet were unable by the diligent labor of a long life to achieve my desire, that would prove that my desire is impossible, and complete hopelessness must follow. Behold, then, the work of a lifetime.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On the floating dogs</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>But far more strange to my mind is the senselessness, the dumb senselessness of these existences. They have no relation whatever to the general life of the community, they hover in the air, and that is all, and life goes on its usual way; someone now and then refers to art and artists, but there it ends. But why, my good dogs, why on earth do these dogs float in the air? What sense is there in their occupation? Why can one get no word of explanation regarding them? Why do they hover up there, letting their legs, the pride of dogs, fall into desuetude, preserving a detachment from the nourishing earth, reaping without having sowed, being particularly well provided for, as I hear, and at the cost of the dog community too.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On dogs like the narrator</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Certainly the fate of types like mine must be a strange one  ...We are the dogs who are crushed by the silence, who long to break through it, literally to get a breath of fresh air; the others seem to thrive on silence: true, that is only so in appearance, as in the case of the musical dogs, who ostensibly were quite calm when they played, but in reality were in a state of intense excitement; nevertheless the illusion is very strong, one tries to make a breach in it, but it mocks every attempt. What help, then, do my colleagues find? What kind of attempts do they make to manage to go on living in spite of everything?
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On progress</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>People often praise the universal progress made by the dog community throughout the ages, and probably mean by that more particularly the progress in knowledge. Certainly knowledge is progressing, its advance is irresistible, it actually progresses at an accelerating speed, always faster, but what is there to praise in that? It is as if one were to praise someone because with the years he grows older, and in consequence comes nearer and nearer to death with increasing speed.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On the past and current generations</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Even in those days wonders did not openly walk the streets for anyone to seize; but all the same, dogs -- I cannot put it in any other way -- had not yet become so doggish as today, the edifice of dogdom was still loosely put together, the true Word could still have intervened, planning or replanning the structure, changing it at will, transforming it into its opposite; and the Word was there, was very near at least, on the tip of everybody&#x27;s tongue, anyone might have hit upon it. And what has become of it today? Today one may pluck out one&#x27;s very heart and not find it. Our generation is lost, it may be, but it is more blameless than those earlier ones. I can understand the hesitation of my generation, indeed it is no longer mere hesitation; it is the thousandth forgetting of a dream dreamt a thousand times and forgotten a thousand times; and who can damn us merely for forgetting for the thousandth time?
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On the ways of procuring food</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>But it seems to me that science nevertheless takes a veiled interest, at least to some extent, in these matters, inasmuch as it recognizes two chief methods of procuring food; namely the actual preparation of the ground, and secondly the auxiliary perfecting processes of incantation, dance, and song. I find here a distinction in accordance with the one I have myself made; not a definitive distinction, perhaps, but yet clear enough. The scratching and watering of the ground, in my opinion, serves to produce both kinds of food, and remains indispensable; incantation, dance, and song, however, are concerned less with the ground food in the narrower sense, and serve principally to attract the food from above.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>An experiment on procuring food</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>In certain circumstances I might have been able to achieve an almost scrupulously exact experiment; namely, if I had succeeded only once in bringing down food by an upward incantation without preparing the ground at all, and then had failed to extract food by an incantation directed exclusively to the ground. I attempted indeed something of this kind, but without any real belief in it and without the conditions being quite perfect; for it is my fixed opinion that a certain amount of ground-preparation is always necessary, and even if the heretics who deny this are right, their theory can never be proved in any case, seeing that the watering of the ground is done under a kind of compulsion, and within certain limits simply cannot be avoided.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On the food falling from the sky</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>But in isolated cases something else happened, something really strange; the food did not fall but followed me through the air; the food pursued the hungry. That never went on for long, always for only a short stretch, then the food fell after all, or vanished completely, or -- the most common case -- my greed put a premature end to the experiment and I swallowed down the tempting food... It only proved what was already known, that the ground not only attracts food vertically from above, but also at a slant, indeed sometimes in spirals... I wished to prove that when I retreated before the food it was not the ground that attracted it at a slant, but I who drew it after me.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>Another experiment in procuring food</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>I resolved to fast completely as long as I could stand it, and at the same time avoid all sight of food, all temptation. If I were to withdraw myself in this manner, remain lying day and night with closed eyes, trouble myself neither to snatch food from the air nor to lift it from the ground, and if, as I dared not expect, yet faintly hoped, without taking any of the customary measures, and merely in response to the unavoidable irrational watering of the ground and the quiet recitation of the incantations and songs (the dance I wished to omit, so as not to weaken my powers) the food were to come of itself from above, and without going near the ground were to knock at my teeth for admittance -- if that were to happen, then ...
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>The encounter with the hound after fainting</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; he asked. &quot;You must leave this place.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t leave it just now,&quot; I said, without trying to explain, for how could I explain everything to him; besides, he seemed to be in a hurry. &quot;Please go away,&quot; he said, impatiently lifting his feet and setting them down again. &quot;Let me be,&quot; I said, &quot;leave me to myself and don&#x27;t worry about me; the others on&#x27;t.&quot; &quot;I ask you to go for your own sake,&quot; he said. &quot;You can ask for any reason you like,&quot; I replied. &quot;I can&#x27;t go even if I wanted to.&quot; &quot;You need have no fear of that,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;You can go all right. It&#x27;s because you seem to be feeble that I ask you to go now, and you can go slowly if you like; if you linger now you&#x27;ll have to race off later on.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s my affair,&quot; I replied. &quot;It&#x27;s mine too,&quot; he said, saddened by my stubbornness...  And I gazed at him -- he had merely shaken his head sadly at my rough answer -- with ever mounting desire. &quot;Who are you?&quot; I asked. &quot;I&#x27;m a hunter,&quot; he replied.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>The hound&#x27;s music</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>He was silent, and then I thought I saw something such as no dog before me had ever seen, at least there is no slightest hint of it in our tradition, and I hastily bowed my head in infinite fear and shame in the pool of blood lying before me. I thought I saw that the hound was already singing without knowing it, nay, more, that the melody, separated from him, was floating on the air in accordance with its own laws, and, as though he had no part in it, was moving toward me, toward me alone. Today, of course, I deny the validity of all such perceptions and ascribe them to my overexcitation at that time, but even if it was an error it had nevertheless a sort of grandeur, and is the sole, even if delusive, reality that I have carried over into this world from my period of fasting, and shows at least how far we can go when we are beyond ourselves.
</p><br/></div><div><span class="mn"><em style="font-size:15px"></em><span>On freedom</span><br/><span style="color:gray"></span></span><p>Of course, quite apart from the circumstances already mentioned, the reason for that can be found in my incapacity for scientific investigation, my limited powers of thought, my bad memory, but above all in my inability to keep my scientific aim continuously before my eyes. It was this instinct that made me -- and perhaps for the sake of science itself, but a different science from that of today, an ultimate science -- prize freedom higher than everything else. Freedom! Certainly such freedom as is possible today is a wretched business. But nevertheless freedom, nevertheless a possession.
