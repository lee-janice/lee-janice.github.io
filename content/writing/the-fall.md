By halfsweet song of winsome Spring, one blooms,<br>
and unfurls pearled wings to the timshel’d skies,<br>
A light divine — in reverie, one flies!<br>
But a wayward gust strips a ruffled plume,<br>
and the fear of demise takes hold, consumes,<br>
the whistling wind whispers that _you’re a lie,_<br>
that _you’re naught but roach in a shallow guise,_<br>
and _the heights you seek only end in ruin._<br>

_To the dirt you belong, not sky, nor tree,_<br>
and whispers turn truth in one’s own esteem,<br>
but solace does lie in the certainty!<br>
_Hide from the light, enjoy filth’s regime!_<br>
And through one’s beady eyes, though beetled be,<br>
this life still does seem a Beauty supreme.
