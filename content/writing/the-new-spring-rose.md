In fear and frost, a feeling seldom lies,<br>
for snows of sorrow froze the starry night.<br>
Through rigid mind rings out a frigid cry;<br>
none bears nor is begot in Winter’s blight.

But shimm’ring spark of Nature’s blessed eye!<br>
breaks through the bitter winds of Winter’s hold,<br>
and fast alights a thing once been decried;<br>
is this of what Time’s muses had foretold?

A measure and a mind does this defy,<br>
and smells as sweet by any mortal stele.<br>
As the new Spring rose, the old Death had died,<br>
and the one act left is for one to feel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Winter will return sure as the tide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as such is Love, and such is Life besides.
