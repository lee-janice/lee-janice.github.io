Slowly—ever so slowly—it all began to turn to dust.

It started in the fields. She almost could have missed the whole event, prancing in the meadow
as she was—one in her position could not help but gaze in upward bliss at the hues of saffron and
rose and lavender that bloomed across the setting skies. She leapt up with glee, relishing in how
the gentle plush of the grass caught her fall and seemed to propel her ever higher and higher and
higher, oblivious to the fine trails of ash that lay in her wake. Just as she was about to burst into
a full gallop with the immensity of it all, she—and this was her folly—glanced down upon herself,
promptly stumbling over her two left feet.

She landed flat on her face with a muted _thump!_ and a grayish puff swept a cloud of particulates
into her eyes and her mouth. For a moment, all she could manage to do was lie in a daze. The sky
tumbled and churned in great circles overhead. In the still of her stupor, the dust finally settled to
the earth—and only then did she attempt to blindly grasp around her for some bare modicum of
sense. She tore up a clenched fist full of grass-blades and splayed it open to a _poof_.

Her spine stiffened and she shot upwards in shock. She could now see clearly the ripples of soot
that streaked her wayward path through the field. She hobbled to her feet, with a half-hope that
the higher vantage point would dispel the irregular scene, but the only thing she now grasped was
just how deeply the blemished veins ran.

She began to feel a chill. In the dying light, she could spot others in the distance—a couple
intertwined, a flock of friends in celebration, a child and a hound—but failed to detect in any of their
silhouettes a sign of the icy panic that now inched and nestled deep into her bones.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _What’s happening to me?_

She fled, homeward bound, not daring to glance down at the clouds of dust that smoked from her
staggering gait. She collapsed against her doorway, fumbling with the lock, and finally broke into
the room with a haggard leap. She turned and barricaded the door, _one, two, three,_ and shuttered
the blinds in a vehement clap.

By now it was night, her room cold and pitch black. She couldn’t bring herself to flip on the ceiling
light, fearing the scene that it might reveal, and instead lit a candle with a match and a _hissss_. The
flame flickered precariously. Overcome by a morbid curiosity, she peered into a mirror.

A distorted figure leered back. This creature was so foreign to her, and impossibly distant, as though
the glass had severed the image’s tether to reality in one cold stroke. Trembling, she brought her
hand to caress its face with what she thought was truth—_was that a moment of pause?_ She ran
her fingers down its body. It felt so strange, so grotesque: her consciousness hung to it by a mere
thread.

Everything was in its wrong place. Was her own flesh and bone, too, fading away? She began to
gasp for certainty as her rib cage spasmed and contorted in her sickly reflection. The left side of her
mouth drooped before her eyes. The asymmetry was nauseating. A shaky inhale rattled her frame,
and she coughed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Why a cough?_

She tore her gaze from the mirror image. The walls around her were crumbling. Plumes of dust
grasped for and choked the air, and her breath caught on a blade.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _No, please, not again—_

She threw herself to the floor, sobbing, using spit and tears and blood and snot in her desperation
to plaster together the splitting walls, smearing the paste over the fractaling gaps—but how
insurmountably wide they were—and the more fiercely she scraped and prayed and clawed to piece them
back together, the faster the earthy substance disintegrated under her fingertips. The worst became
undeniably, horrifically true. This ruin was her own doing.

There was no shield from the world now. As far as one’s eye could discern, all structure and form
and shelter had crumbled away. A bare existence lay strewn on its remains. She numbed herself to
the ground, rocking back and forth, humming and humming a hope into the ether,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _is anyone there?_

Was she even sure that there was ever someone there? Was it always just dust?

A piercing tone began to fade in and out of her wavering perception. Through her tear-stricken eyes
she could barely make out the constellations overhead—but she fastened the last of her hopes to
them, spinning her around and around in their celestial dance. In this great whirling, it all soon felt
just like a dream...

Then, one by one, a light was extinguished from the heavens and fell towards the earth.

_Thump. thump. thump._ Each speck of stardust thumped like thunder, echoing and booming in her
ears. But she felt nothing—in her numbness she lay dormant as the dust made hilltops and peaks
and valleys and caverns of her body. A muted thought washed over her of how many stars had
once littered the skies and how much there was left to fall. The showering turned into a torrential
downpour. She waited for it to consume her.

But then some visceral thing erupted—some primal frenzy to persist, to not be buried in this—and
she began to claw upwards through the endless mounds, tearing at them with limb over limb in her
struggle to stay afloat, so unsure of where her body ended and the dust began—maybe she was losing
herself to it—and it scorched her lungs as she labored for each gasp of air, stopping her heart—

And she hit a wall.

There was no space left to go. The dust compacted inward, becoming ever more dense, splaying
whatever remained of her being against this dome that immobilized her. She was being compressed
by nothing into nothing, nothing, nothing...

<hr style="border-top: dotted 1px;" />

But just as she was fading away, from all directions, came a resounding golden chord!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _I Am!_

Answering the call, she pushed blindly into the impasse—

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; —and it burst open, flinging her far out into a void, beyond the known, cast forth on a free-fall
into a vast expanse of potentialities; she saw in a dizzy splendor the tendrils of matter that blossomed
outwards from the rupture of her cage, and the patterns of chaos and cosmos that intertwined in
a kaleidoscopic dance.

And then, in a speck of dust that chanced to float her by... she saw the
Universe entire. She couldn’t help but laugh.
