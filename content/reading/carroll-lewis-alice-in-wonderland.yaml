          Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
          on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had
          peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
          pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book,"
          thought Alice, "without pictures or conversation?"

          First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little 
          nervous about this; 'for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, 'in my going out altogether, like a 
          candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle looks like 
          after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.

          Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little 
          different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, 'Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!'

          'Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, "Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you. - Come, 
          I'll take no denial: We must have the trial; For really this morning I've nothing to do." Said the 
          mouse to the cur, "Such a trial, dear sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath." 
          "I'll be the judge, I'll be the jury," Said the cunning old Fury, "I'll try the whole cause, and condemn 
          you to death."

          A bit jarring for a children's novel, wouldn't one think? Also, reminds me of The Trial by Franz Kafka in 
          its absurdity.

          ...the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, 'he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.' 
          A bright idea came into Alice's head. 'Is' that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.
          'Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: 'it's always tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles. 
          'Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.
          'Exactly so,' said the Hatter: 'as the things get used up.'
          'But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice ventured to ask.
          'Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted, yawning.

          This makes me think of tautologies - especially since Carroll was a mathematician. See the quote on page 129.

          'You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the 
          moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'
          'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.
          'Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess, 'Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.'

          'And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. 
          'Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: 'nine the next, and so on.'
          'What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice. 
          'That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon remarked: 'because they lessen from day to day.'
          This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. 
          'Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?'
          'Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.
          'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
          'That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone.

          Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
          hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
          she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
          loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
          her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
          with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
          Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
          simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
          remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
