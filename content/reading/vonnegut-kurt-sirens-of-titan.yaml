          Everyone now knows how to find the meaning of life within himself. 
          But mankind wasn't always so lucky. Less than a century ago men and women did not have
          easy access to the puzzle boxes within them.
          They could not name even one of the fifty-three portals to the soul.

          Gimcrack religions were big business. Mankind, ignorant of the truths that lie within every
          human being, looked outward — pushed ever outward. What mankind hoped to learn in its
          outward push was who was actually in charge of all creation, and what all creation was all about.

          Mankind flung its advance agents ever outward, ever outward. Eventually it flung them out
          into space, into the colorless, tasteless, weightless sea of outwardness without end.
          It flung them like stones.
          These unhappy agents found what had already been found in abundance on Earth — a
          nightmare of meaninglessness without end. The bounties of space, of infinite outwardness, were
          three: empty heroics, low comedy, and pointless death.
          Outwardness lost, at last, its imagined attractions.
          Only inwardness remained to be explored.
          Only the human soul remained terra incognita.
          This was the beginning of goodness and wisdom.
          What were people like in olden times, with their souls as yet unexplored?

          Winston Niles Rumfoord had run his private space ship right into the heart of an uncharted
          chrono-synclastic infundibulum two days out of Mars. Only his dog had been along. Now
          Winston Niles Rumfoord and his dog Kazak existed as wave phenomena — apparently pulsing
          in a distorted spiral with its origin in the Sun and its terminal in Betelgeuse.
          The earth was about to intercept that spiral.

          CHRONO-SYNCLASTIC INFUNDIBULA — Just imagine that your Daddy is the smartest man
          who ever lived on Earth, and he knows everything there is to find out, and he is exactly right
          about everything, and he can prove he is right about everything. Now imagine another little child
          on some nice world a million light years away, and that little child's Daddy is the smartest man
          who ever lived on that nice world so far away. And he is just as smart and just as right as your
          Daddy is. Both Daddies are smart, and both Daddies are right. ...
          The reason both Daddies can be right and still get into terrible fights is because there are so
          many different ways of being right. There are places in the Universe, though, where each Daddy
          could finally catch on to what the other Daddy was talking about. These places are where all the
          different kinds of truths fit together as nicely as the parts in your Daddy's solar watch. We call
          these places chrono-synclastic infundibula. ...
          You might think it would be nice to go to a chrono-synclastic infundibulum and see all the
          different ways to be absolutely right, but it is a very dangerous thing to do. The poor man and his
          poor dog are scattered far and wide, not just through space, but through time, too.
          Chrono (kroh-no) means time. Synclastic (sin-class-tick) means curved toward the same side
          in all directions, like the skin of an orange. Infundibulum (in-fun-dib-u-lum) is what the ancient
          Romans like Julius Caesar and Nero called a funnel. If you don't know what a funnel is, get
          Mommy to show you one.

          He was a speculator, mostly in corporate securities.
          In the depressions that always followed his taking of alcohol, narcotics, and women, Constant
          pined for just one thing — a single message that was sufficiently dignified and important to merit
          his carrying it humbly between two points.
          The motto under the coat of arms that Constant had designed for himself said simply, The
          Messenger Awaits.
          What Constant had in mind, presumably, was a first. class message from God to someone
          equally distinguished.

          Bobby Denton's voice grew hoarse and hushed. "You want to fly through space? God has
          already given you the most wonderful space ship in all creation! Yes! Speed? You want speed?
          The space ship God has given you goes sixty-six thousand miles an hour — and will keep on
          running at that speed for all eternity, if God wills it. You want a space ship that will carry men in
          comfort? You've got it! It won't carry just a rich man and his dog, or just five men or ten men.
          No! God is no piker! He's given you a space ship that will carry billions of men, women, and
          children! Yes! And they don't have to stay strapped in chairs or wear fishbowls over their heads.
          No! Not on God's space ship. The people on God's space ship can go swimming, and walk in the
          sunshine and play baseball and go ice skating and go for family rides in the family automobile on
          Sunday after church and a family chicken dinner!"
          Bobby Denton nodded. "Yes!" he said. "And if anybody thinks his God is mean for putting
          things out in space to stop us from flying out there, just let him remember the space ship God
          already gave us. And we don't have to buy the fuel for it, and worry and fret over what kind of
          fuel to use. No! God worries about all that.
          "God told us what we had to do on this wonderful space ship. He wrote the rules so anybody
          could understand them. You don't have to be a physicist or a great chemist or an Albert Einstein
          to understand them. No! And He didn't make a whole lot of rules, either. They tell me that if they
          were to fire The Whale, they would have to make eleven thousand separate checks before they
          could be sure it was ready to go: Is this valve open, is that valve dosed, is that wire tight, is that
          tank full? — and on and on and on to eleven thousand things to check. Here on God's space ship,
          God only gives us ten things to check — and not for any little trip to some big, dead poisonous
          stones out in space, but for a trip to the Kingdom of Heaven! Think of it! Where would you
          rather be tomorrow — on Mars or in the Kingdom of Heaven?
          "You know what the check list is on God's round, green space ship? Do I have to tell you?
          You want to hear God's countdown?"
          The Love Crusaders shouted back that they did.
          "Ten! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you covet thy neighbor's house, or his manservant, or his
          maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything that is thy neighbor's?"
          "No!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "Nine! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you bear false witness against thy neighbor?"
          "No!" cried the Love Crusaders. "Eight! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you steal?" "No!" cried
          the Love Crusaders. "Seven! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you commit adultery?"
          "No!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "Six! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you kill?"
          "No!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "Five! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you honor thy father and thy mother?"
          "Yes!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "Four! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy?"
          "Yes!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "Three! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you take the name of the Lord thy God in vain?"
          "No!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "Two! — " said Bobby Denton. "Do you make any graven images?"
          "No!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "One! — " cried Bobby Denton. "Do you put any gods before the one true Lord thy God?"
          "No!" cried the Love Crusaders.
          "Blast off!" shouted Bobby Denton joyfully. "Paradise, here we come! Blast off, children, and
          Amen!"

          "We've got a right!" shouted a woman. She showed her two fine children to Constant.
          Another woman told Constant what it was the crowd felt it had a right to. "We've got a right to
          know what's going on!" she cried.
          The riot, then, was an exercise in science and theology — a seeking after clues by the living as

          "Man — you must have some kind of guardian angel — lets you keep cool as a cucumber, no
          matter what," said the chauffeur admiringly.
          This comment interested Constant, for it described well his attitude in the midst of the mob.
          He took the comment at first as an analogy — as a poetic description of his mood. A man who
          had a guardian angel would certainly have felt just as Constant had — "Yes, suh!" said the
          chauffeur. "Sumpin' sure must be lookin' out for you!"
          Then it hit Constant: This was exactly the case.
          Until that moment of truth, Constant had looked upon his Newport adventure as one more
          drug-induced hallucination — as one more peyotl party — vivid, novel, entertaining, and of no
          consequence whatsoever.
          The little door had been a dreamy touch . . . the dry fountain another . . . and the huge painting
          of the all white touch-me-not little girl with the all white pony . . . and the chimney-like room
          under the spiral staircase . . . and the photograph of the three sirens on Titan . . . and Rumfoord's
          prophecies . . . and the discomfiture of Beatrice Rumfoord at the top of the stairs . . .
          Malachi Constant broke into a cold sweat. His knees threatened to buckle and his eyelids came
          unhinged. He was finally understanding that every bit of it had been real! He had been calm in
          the midst of the mob because he knew he wasn't going to die on Earth.
          Something was looking out for him, all right.

          "Beg your pardon?" said Constant nauseously. He was looking through the plastic dome of the
          cockpit cover — looking up into the evening sky. He was wondering if there could possibly be
          eyes up there, eyes that could see everything he did. And if there were eyes up there, and they
          wanted him to do certain things, go certain places — how could they make him?

          "Jonah," said the pilot.

          Fern read two books a day. It has been said that Aristotle was the last man to be familiar with
          the whole of his own culture. Ransom K. Fern had made an impressive attempt to equal
          Aristotle's achievement. He had been somewhat less successful than Aristotle in perceiving
          patterns in what he knew.
          The intellectual mountain had labored to produce a philosophical mouse — and Fern was the
          first to admit that it was a mouse, and a mangy mouse at that. As Fern expressed the philosophy
          conversationally, in its simplest terms:
          "You go up to a man, and you say, 'How are things going, Joe?' And he says, 'Oh, fine, fine —
          couldn't be better.' And you look into his eyes, and you see things really couldn't be much worse.
          When you get right down to it, everybody's having a perfectly lousy time of it, and I mean
          everybody. And the hell of it is, nothing seems to help much."
          This philosophy did not sadden him. It did not make him brood.
          It made him heartlessly watchful.
          It helped in business, too — for it let Fern assume automatically that the other fellow was far
          weaker and far more bored than he seemed.

          The first sentence in Genesis, as some people may know, is: "In the beginning God created the
          heaven and the earth." Noel Constant wrote the sentence in capital letters, put periods between
          the letters, divided the letters into pairs, rendering the sentence as follows: "I.N., T.H., E.B.,
          E.G., I.N., N.I., N.G., G.O., D.C., R.E., A.T., E.D., T.H., E.H., E.A., V.E., N.A., N.D., T.H.,
          E.E., A.R., T.H."
          And then he looked for corporations with those initials, and bought shares in them. His rule at
          the beginning was that he would own shares in only one corporation at a time, would invest his
          whole nest-egg in it, and would sell the instant the value of his shares had doubled.

          watch if you had a whole office building jammed to the rafters with industrial bureaucrats —

          The detail in the furnishings of Room 223 that interested young Malachi so was a photograph
          of himself. It was a photograph of himself at the age of three — a photograph of a sweet,
          pleasant, game little boy on an ocean beach.
          It was thumbtacked to the wall.
          It was the only picture in the room.
          Old Noel saw young Malachi looking at the picture, and was confused and embarrassed by the
          whole thing about fathers and sons. He ransacked his mind for something good to say, and
          found almost nothing.

          That is when I started the business with the Bible and you know what happened after that. It
          looked as though somebody or something wanted me to own the whole planet even though I was
          as good as dead. I kept my eyes open for some kind of signal that would tell me what it was all
          about but there wasn't any signal. I just went on getting richer and richer.
          And then your mother sent me that picture of you on the beach and the way you looked at me
          out of that picture made me think maybe you were what all the big money buildup was for. I
          decided I would die without ever seeing any sense to it and maybe you would be the one who

          The reason I told Ransom K. Fern to give you this letter only if your luck turned bad is that

          The person chiefly responsible for the technological triumphs of the Martian suicide was Salo,
          Rumfoord's friend on Titan. Salo was a messenger from the planet Tralfamadore in the Small
          Magellanic Cloud. Salo had technological know-how from a civilization that was millions of
          Earthling years old. Salo had a space ship that was crippled — but, even in its crippled condition,
          it was by far the most marvelous space ship that the Solar System had ever seen. His crippled
          ship, stripped of luxury features, was the prototype of all the ships of Mars. While Salo himself
          was not a very good engineer, he was none the less able to measure every part of his ship, and to
          draw up the plans for its Martian descendants.
          Most important of all — Salo had in his possession a quantity of the most powerful
          conceivable source of energy, UWTB, or the Universal Will to Become. Salo generously donated
          half of his supply of UWTB to the suicide of Mars.

          They have weak powers of telepathy. The messages they are capable of transmitting and

          messages. The first is an automatic response to the second, and the second is an automatic
          response to the first.
          The first is, "Here I am, here I am, here I am."
          The second is, "So glad you are, so glad you are, so glad you are."
          There is one last characteristic of the creatures that has not been explained on utilitarian
          grounds: the creatures seem to like to arrange themselves in striking patterns on the
          phosphorescent walls.
          Though blind and indifferent to anyone's watching, they often arrange themselves so as to
          present a regular and dazzling pattern of jonquil-yellow and vivid aquamarine diamonds. The
          yellow comes from the bare cave walls. The aquamarine is the light of the walls filtered through
          the bodies of the creatures.
          Because of their love for music and their willingness to deploy themselves in the service of
          beauty, the creatures are given a lovely name by Earthlings.
          They are called harmoniums.

          Once upon a time on Tralfamadore there were creatures who weren't anything like machines.
          They weren't dependable. They weren't efficient. They weren't predictable. They weren't durable.
          And these poor creatures were obsessed by the idea that everything that existed had to have a
          purpose, and that some purposes were higher than others.
          These creatures spent most of their time trying to find out what their purpose was. And every
          time they found out what seemed to be a purpose of themselves, the purpose seemed so low that
          the creatures were filled with disgust and shame.
          And, rather than serve such a low purpose, the creatures would make a machine to serve it.
          This left the creatures free to serve higher purposes. But whenever they found a higher purpose,
          the purpose still wasn't high enough.
          So machines were made to serve higher purposes, too.
          And the machines did everything so expertly that they were finally given the job of finding out
          what the highest purpose of the creatures could be.
          The machines reported in all honesty that the creatures couldn't really be said to have any
          purpose at all.
          The creatures thereupon began slaying each other, because they hated purposeless things
          above all else. And they discovered that they weren't even very good at slaying. So they turned
          that job over to the machines, too. And the machines finished up the job in less time than it takes
          to say, "Tralfamadore."

          "No, no — no pity, please," said Rumfoord, stepping back, afraid of being touched. "It's a
          very good thing, really. I'll be seeing a lot of new things, a lot of new creatures." He tried to
          smile. "One gets tired, you know, being caught up in the monotonous clockwork of the Solar
          System." He laughed harshly. "After all," he said, "it isn't as though I were dying or something.
          Everything that ever was always will be, and everything that ever will be always was." He shook
          his head quickly, and cast away a tear he hadn't known was on his eyelid.

          An explosion on the Sun had separated man and dog. A Universe schemed in mercy would
          have kept man and dog together.
          The Universe inhabited by Winston Niles Rumfoord and his dog was not schemed in mercy.
          Kazak had been sent ahead of his master on the great mission to nowhere and nothing.

          "I am not dying," said Rumfoord. "I am merely taking my leave of the Solar System. And I am
          not even doing that. In the grand, in the timeless, in the chrono-synclastic infundibulated way of
          looking at things, I shall always be here. I shall always be wherever I've been. 
          "I'm honeymooning with you still, Beatrice," he said. "I'm talking to you still in a little room
          under the stairway in Newport, Mr. Constant. Yes — and playing peek-a-boo in the caves of
          Mercury with you and Boaz. And Chrono — " he said, "I'm watching you still as you play
          German batball so well on the iron playground of Mars."
          He groaned. It was a tiny groan — and so sad.
          The sweet, mild air of Titan carried the tiny groan away.
          "Whatever we've said, friends, we're saying still — such as it was, such as it is, such as it will
          be," said Rumfoord.
          The tiny groan came again.
          Rumfoord watched it leave as though it were a smoke ring.
          "There is something you should know about life in the Solar System," he said. "Being chrono-
          synclastic infundibulated, I've known about it all along. It is, none the less, such a sickening
          thing that I've thought about it as little as possible.
          "The sickening thing is this:
          "Everything that every Earthling has ever done has been warped by creatures on a planet one-
          hundred-and-fifty thousand light years away. The name of the planet is Tralfamadore.

          "There it is — friend," he said to his memory of Rumfoord, "and much consolation may it give
          you, Skip. Much pain it cost your old friend Salo. In order to give it to you — even too late —
          your old friend Salo had to make war against the core of his being, against the very nature of
          being a machine.
          "You asked the impossible of a machine," said Salo, "and the machine complied.
          "The machine is no longer a machine," said Salo. "The machine's contacts are corroded, his
          bearings fouled, his circuits shorted, and his gears stripped. His mind buzzes and pops like the
          mind of an Earthling — fizzes and overheats with thoughts of love, honor, dignity, rights,
          accomplishment, integrity, independence — "
          Old Salo picked up the message again from Rumfoord's contour chair. It was written on a thin
          square of aluminum. The message was a single dot.
          "Would you like to know how I have been used, how my life has been wasted?" he said.
          "Would you like to know what the message is that I have been carrying for almost half a million
          Earthling years — the message I am supposed to carry for eighteen million more years?"
          He held out the square of aluminum in a cupped foot.
          "A dot," he said.
          "A single dot," he said.
          "The meaning of a dot in Tralfamadorian," said Old Salo, "is —
          "Greetings."
          The little machine from Tralfamadore, having delivered this message to himself, to Constant,
          to Beatrice, and to Chrono over a distance of one hundred and fifty thousand light years,
          bounded abruptly out of the courtyard and onto the beach outside.
          He killed himself out there. He took himself apart and threw his parts in all directions.

          "I miss her," he said.
          "You finally fell in love, I see," said Salo.
          "Only an Earthling year ago," said Constant. "It took us that long to realize that a purpose of
          human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved."

          On the trip back to Earth, Salo suspected that he had made a tragic mistake in suggesting to
          Constant that he return to Earth. He had begun to suspect this when Constant insisted on being
          taken to Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A.

          "You are tired, so very tired, Space Wanderer, Malachi, Unk," said Salo. "Stare at the faintest
          star, Earthling, and think how heavy your limbs are growing."
          "Heavy," said Constant.
          "You are going to die some day, Unk," said Salo. "Sorry, but it's true."
          "True," said Constant. "Don't be sorry."
          "When you know you are dying, Space Wanderer," said Salo hypnotically, "a wonderful thing
          will happen to you." He then described to Constant the happy things that Constant would
          imagine before his life flickered out.
          It would be a post-hypnotic illusion.

          "Good luck," whispered Salo.
          "We don't say that down here," whispered Constant.
          Salo winked. "I'm not from down here," he whispered. He looked around at the perfectly white
          world, felt the wet kisses of the snowflakes, pondered hidden meanings in the pale yellow
          streetlights that shone in a world so whitely asleep. "Beautiful," he whispered.

          Salo had hypnotized him so that he would imagine, as he died, that he saw his best and only
          friend, Stony Stevenson.
          As the snow drifted over Constant, he imagined that the clouds opened up, letting through a
          sunbeam, a sunbeam all for him.
          A golden space ship encrusted with diamonds came skimming down the sunbeam, landed in
          the untouched snow of the street.
          Out stepped a stocky, red-headed man with a big cigar. He was young. He wore the uniform of
          the Martian Assault Infantry, Unk's old outfit.
          "Hello, Unk," he said. "Get in."
          "Get in?" said Constant. "Who are you?"
          "Stony Stevenson, Unk. You don't recognize me?"
          "Stony?" said Constant. "That's you, Stony?"
          "Who else could stand the bloody pace?" said Stony. He laughed. "Get in," he said.
          "And go where?" said Constant.
          "Paradise," said Stony.
          "What's Paradise like?" said Constant. "Everybody's happy there forever," said Stony, "or as
          long as the bloody Universe holds together. Get in, Unk. Beatrice is already there, waiting for
          you."
          "Beatrice?" said Unk, getting into the space ship. Stony closed the airlocks, pressed the on
          button. "We're — we're going to Paradise now?" said Constant. "I — I'm going to get into
          Paradise?"
          "Don't ask me why, old sport," said Stony, "but somebody up there likes you."
