          All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really
          was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have
          his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I've changed all the names.

          We asked him how

          so hard, and because there wasn't much shelter or food or clothing. But things were much better now. He
          had a pleasant little apartment, and his daughter was getting an excellent education. His mother was
          incinerated in the Dresden fire-storm. So it goes.

          one American foot soldier is arrested in the ruins for taking a teapot. And he's given a regular trial, and
          then he's shot by a firing squad.'

          'Um,' said O'Hare.

          'Don't you think that's really where the climax should come?' 'I don't know anything about it,' he said.

          I think about my education sometimes. I went to the University of Chicago for a while after the Second
          World War. I was a student in the Department of Anthropology. At that time, they were teaching that
          there was absolutely no difference between anybody. They may be teaching that still.
          Another thing they taught was that nobody was ridiculous or bad or disgusting. Shortly before my
          father died, he said to me, 'You know-you never wrote a story with a villain in it.'
          I told him that was one of the things I learned in college after the war.

          The truth is death, he wrote. I've fought nicely against it as long as I could... danced with it,
          festooned it, waltzed it around... decorated it with streamers, titillated it...

          Time obsessed him. Miss Ostrovsky reminded me of the amazing scene in Death on the Installment

          I looked through the Gideon Bible in my motel room for tales of great destruction. The sun was risen
          upon the Earth when Lot entered into Zo-ar, I read. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon
          Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven; and He overthrew those cities, and all
          the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

          So it goes.

          Those were vile people in both those cities, as is well known. The world was better off without them.

          And Lot's wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had
          been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.

          She was turned to a pillar of salt. So it goes.

          People aren't supposed to look back. I'm certainly not going to do it anymore.

          I've finished my war book now. The next one I write is going to be fun.

          This one is a failure, and had to be, since it was written by a pillar of salt. It begins like this:

          Billy was working on his second letter when the first letter was published. The second letter started out
          like this:

          'The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to
          die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments,
          past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the
          different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can
          see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an
          illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once
          a moment is gone it is gone forever.

          'When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad condition in that
          particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself
          hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people,
          which is "so it goes."'

          And so on.

          Billy Pilgrim had stopped in the forest. He was leaning against a tree with his eyes closed. His head
          was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring. He was like a poet in the Parthenon.

          This was when Billy first came unstuck in time. His attention began to swing grandly through the full arc
          of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. There wasn't anybody else there, or any thing. There
          was just violet light and a hum.

          And then Billy swung into life again, going backwards until he was in pre-birth, which was red light and
          bubbling sounds. And then he swung into life again and stopped. He was a little boy taking a shower with
          his hairy father at the Ilium Y.M.C.A. He smelled chlorine from the swimming pool next door, heard the
          springboard boom.

          Little Billy was terrified, because his father had said Billy was going to learn to swim by the method of
          sink-or-swim. Ms father was going to throw Billy into the deep end, and Billy was going to damn well
          swim.

          It was like an execution. Billy was numb as his father carried him from the shower room to the pool.
          His eyes were closed. When he opened his eyes, he was on the bottom of the pool, and there was
          beautiful music everywhere. He lost consciousness, but the music went on. He dimly sensed that
          somebody was rescuing him. Billy resented that.

          From there he traveled in time to 1965. He was forty-one years old, and he was visiting his decrepit
          mother at Pine Knoll, an old people's home he had put her in only a month before. She had caught
          pneumonia, and wasn't expected to live. She did live, though, for years after that.

          Her voice was nearly gone, so, in order to hear her, Billy had to put his ear right next to her papery
          lips. She evidently had something very important to say.

          'How ...?' she began, and she stopped. She was too tired. She hoped that she wouldn't have to say
          the rest of the sentence, and that Billy would finish it for her

          But Billy had no idea what was on her mind. 'How what, Mother?' he prompted.

          She swallowed hard, shed some tears. Then she gathered energy from all over her ruined body, even
          from her toes and fingertips. At last she bad accumulated enough to whisper this complete sentence:

          'How did I get so old ?'

          you look in there deeply enough, you'll see Adam and Eve.'

          Billy Pilgrim had not heard this anecdote. But, lying on the black ice there, Billy stared into the patina
          of the corporal's boots, saw Adam and Eve in the golden depths. They were naked. They were so
          innocent, so vulnerable, so eager to behave decently. Billy Pilgrim loved them.

          Even though Billy's train wasn't moving, its boxcars were kept locked tight. Nobody was to get off
          until the final destination. To the guards who walked up and down outside, each car became a single
          organism which ate and drank and excreted through its ventilators. It talked or sometimes yelled through
          its ventilators, too. In went water and loaves of blackbread and sausage and cheese, and out came shit
          and piss and language.

          Human beings in there were excreting into steel helmets, which were passed to the people at the
          ventilators, who dumped them. Billy was a dumper. The human beings also passed canteens, which
          guards would fill with water. When food came in, the human beings were quiet and trusting and beautiful.

          are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti. And Tralfamadorians don't see human beings as two-legged

          So they were trying to re-invent themselves and their universe. Science fiction was a big help.

          Rosewater said an interesting thing to Billy one time about a book that wasn't science fiction. He said
          that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov, by Feodor Dostoevsky.
          'But that isn't enough any more.' said Rosewater.

          Another time Billy heard Rosewater say to a psychiatrist, 'I think you guys are going to have to come
          up with a lot of wonderful new lies, or people just aren't going to want to go on living.'

          Rosewater was on the next bed, reading, and Billy drew him into the conversation, asked him what he
          was reading this time.

          So Rosewater told him. It was The Gospel from Outer Space, by Kilgore Trout. It was about a
          visitor from outer space, shaped very much like a Tralfamadorian by the way. The visitor from outer
          space made a serious study of Christianity, to learn, if he could, why Christians found it so easy to be
          cruel. He concluded that at least part of the trouble was slipshod storytelling in the New Testament. He
          supposed that the intent of the Gospels was to teach people, among other things, to be merciful, even to
          the lowest of the low.

          But the Gospels actually taught this:
          Before you kill somebody, make absolutely sure he isn't well connected. So it goes.

          The flaw in the Christ stories, said the visitor from outer space, was that Christ, who didn't look like
          much, was actually the Son of the Most Powerful Being in the Universe. Readers understood that, so,
          when they came to the crucifixion, they naturally thought, and Rosewater read out loud again:

          Oh, boy-they sure picked the wrong guy to lynch that time!
          And that thought had a brother: 'There are right people to lynch .' Who? People not well connected.
          So it goes.

          The visitor from outer space made a gift to Earth of a new Gospel. In it, Jesus really was a nobody,
          and a pain in the neck to a lot of people with better connections than he had. He still got to say all the
          lovely and puzzling things he said in the otherGospels.

          So the people amused themselves one day by nailing him to a cross and planting the cross in the
          ground. There couldn't possibly be any repercussions, the lynchers thought. The reader would have to
          think that, too, since the new Gospel hammered home again and again what a nobody Jesus was.
          And then, just before the nobody died, the heavens opened up, and there was thunder and lightning.

          The voice of God came crashing down. He told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son
          giving him the full powers and privileges of The Son of the Creator of the Universe throughout all eternity.
          God said this From this moment on, He will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has
          no connections!

          with sex on Earth. They said their flying-saucer crews had identified no fewer than seven sexes on Earth,
          each essential to reproduction. Again: Billy couldn't possibly imagine what five of those seven sexes had
          to do with the making of a baby, since they were sexually active only in the fourth dimension.

          The Tralfamadorians tried to give Billy clues that would help him imagine sex in the invisible dimension.
          They told him that there could be no Earthling babies without male homosexuals. There could be babies
          without female homosexuals. There couldn't be babies without women over sixty-five years old. There
          could be babies without men over sixty-five. There couldn't be babies without other babies who had lived
          an hour or less after birth. And so on.

          It was gibberish to Billy.

          There was a lot that Billy said that was gibberish to the Tralfamadorians, too. They couldn't imagine
          what time looked like to him. Billy had given up on explaining that. The guide outside had to explain as
          best he could.

          The guide invited the crowd to imagine that they were looking across a desert at a mountain range on a
          day that was twinkling bright and clear. They could look at a peak or a bird or a cloud, at a stone right in
          front of them, or even down into a canyon behind them. But among them was this poor Earthling, and his
          head was encased in a steel sphere which he could never take off. There was only one eyehole through
          which he could look, and welded to that eyehole were six feet of pipe.

          This was only the beginning of Billy's miseries in the metaphor. He was also strapped to a steel lattice
          which was bolted to a flatcar on rails, And there was no way he could turn his head or touch the pipe.
          The far end of the piperested on a bi-pod which was also bolted to the flatcar. All Billy could see was the
          dot at the end of the pipe. He didn't know he was on a flatcar, didn't even know there was anything
          peculiar about his situation.

          The flatcar sometimes crept, sometimes went extremely fast, often stopped-went uphill, downhill,
          around curves, along straightaways. Whatever poor Billy saw through the pipe, he had no choice but to
          say to himself, 'That's life.'

          But the subject of war never came up until Billy brought it up himself. Somebody in the zoo crowd
          asked him through the lecturer what the most valuable thing he had learned on Tralfamadore was so far,
          and Billy replied, 'How the inhabitants of a whole planet can live in peace. As you know, I am from a
          planet that has been engaged in senseless slaughter since the beginning of time. I myself have seen the
          bodies of schoolgirls who were boiled alive in a water tower by my own countrymen, who were proud of
          fighting pure evil at the time. ' This was true. Billy saw the boiled bodies in Dresden. 'And I have lit my
          way in a prison at night with candles from the fat of human beings who were butchered by the brothers
          and fathers of those school girls who were boiled. Earthlings must be the terrors of the Universe! If other
          planets aren't now in danger from Earth, they soon will be. So tell me the secret so I can take it back to

          Billy felt that he had spoken soaringly. He was baffled when he saw the Tralfamadorians close their
          little hands on their eyes. He knew from past experience what this meant: He was being stupid.

          'Would-would you mind telling me,' he said to the guide, much deflated, 'what was so stupid about
          that?'

          'We know how the Universe ends,' said the guide, 'and Earth has nothing to do with it, except that it
          gets wiped out, too.'

          'How-how does the Universe end?' said Billy.

          'We blow it up, experimenting with new fuels for our flying saucers. A Tralfamadorian test pilot
          presses a starter button, and the whole Universe disappears.' So it goes.

          "If You know this," said Billy, 'isn't there some way you can prevent it? Can't you keep the pilot from
          pressing the button?'

          'He has always pressed it, and he always will . We always let him and we always will let him. The
          moment is structured that way.'

          'So,' said Billy gropingly, I suppose that the idea of, preventing war on Earth is stupid, too. '

          'Of course.'

          'But you do have a peaceful planet here.'

          'Today we do. On other days we have wars as horrible as any you've ever seen or read about. There
          isn't anything we can do about them, so we simply don't look at them. We ignore them. We spend
          eternity looking at pleasant moments-like today at the zoo. Isn't this a nice moment?'

          'Yes.'

          'That's one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: Ignore the awful times, and
          concentrate on the good ones.'

          'Um,' said Billy Pilgrim.

          America is the wealthiest nation on Earth, but its people are mainly poor, and poor Americans
          are urged to hate themselves. To quote the American humoristKin Hubbard , 'It ain't no disgrace
          to be poor, but might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though
          America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but
          extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No
          such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The
          meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to
          have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'If you're so smart, why ain't you rich? ' There
          will also be an American flag no larger than a child's hand-glued to a lollipop stick and, flying
          from the cash register...

          Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue, the
          monograph went on. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make
          money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those
          who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a
          treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately,
          than any other ruling class since, say, Napoleonic times.

          Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without
          precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love
          themselves. Once this is understood the disagreeable behavior of American enlisted men in
          German prisons ceases to be a mystery...

          A prison administrator dealing with captured American enlisted men for the first time should be
          warned: Expect no brotherly love, even between brothers. There will be no cohesion between the
          individuals. Each will be a sulky child who often wishes he were dead.

          He found two small sources, two lumps an inch apart and hidden in the lining. One was shaped like a

          was told not to find out what the lumps were. He was advised to be content with knowing that they could

          Billy is speaking before a capacity audience in a baseball park, which is covered by a geodesic dome.
          The flag of the country is behind him. It is a Hereford Bull on a field of green. Billy predicts his own death
          within an hour. He laughed about it, invites the crowd to laugh with him. 'It is high time I was dead..' he
          says. 'Many years ago.' he said, 'a certain man promised to have me killed. He is an old man now, living
          not far from here. He has read all the publicity associated with my appearance in your fair city. He is
          insane. Tonight he will keep his promise.'

          There are protests from the crowd.

          Billy Pilgrim rebukes them. 'If you protest, if you think that death is a terrible thing, then you have not
          understood a word I've said.' Now he closes his speech as he closes every speech with these words:
          'Farewell, hello, farewell, hello.'

          There are police around him as he leaves the stage. They are there to protect him from the crush of
          popularity. No threats on his life have been made since 1945. The police offer to stay with him. They are
          floridly willing to stand in a circle around him all night, with their zap guns drawn.

          'No, no,' says Billy serenely. 'It is time for you to go home to your wives and children, and it is time for
          me to be dead for a little while-and then live again.' At that moment, Billy's high forehead is in the cross
          hairs of a high-powered laser gun. It is aimed at him from the darkened press box. In the next moment,
          Billy Pilgrim is dead. So it goes.

          So Billy experiences death for a while. It is simply violet light and a hum. There isn't anybody else
          there. Not even Billy Pilgrim is there.

          Derby, who was washing a window outside. The spoon was a tablespoon. Billy thrust it into the vat,
          turned it around and around, making a gooey lollipop. He thrust it into his mouth.

          A moment went by, and then every cell in Billy's body shook him with ravenous gratitude and

          His stance was that of a punch-drunk fighter. His head was down, his fists were out front, waiting for
          information and battle plan. Derby raised his head, called Campbell a snake. He corrected that. He said
          that snakes couldn't help being snakes, and that Campbell, who could help being what he was, was
          something much lower than a snake or a rat-or even a blood-filled tick.

          Campbell smiled.

          Derby spoke movingly of the American form of government, with freedom and justice and
          opportunities and fair play for all. He said there wasn't a man there who wouldn't gladly die for those
          ideals.

          He spoke of the brotherhood between the American and the Russian people, and how those two
          nations were going to crush the disease of Nazism, which wanted to infect the whole world.

          Unexpectedly, Billy Pilgrim found himself upset by the song and the occasion. He had never had an old

          experiments with chords-chords intentionally sour, sourer still, unbearably sour, and then a chord that
          was suffocatingly sweet, and then some sour ones again. Billy had powerful psychosomatic responses to

          proof that he had a great big secret somewhere inside, and he could not imagine what it was...

          These fictitious people in the zoo had a big board supposedly showing stock market, quotations and
          commodity prices along one wall of their habitat, and a news ticker, and a telephone that was supposedly
          connected to a brokerage on Earth. The creatures on Zircon-212 told their captives that they had
          invested a million dollars for them back on Earth, and that it was up to the captives to manage it so that
          they would be fabulously wealthy when they returned to Earth.

          The telephone and the big board and the ticker were all fakes, of-course. They were simply stimulants
          to make the Earthlings perform vividly for the crowds at the zoo--to make them jump up and down and
          cheer, or gloat, or sulk, or tear their hair, to be scared shitless or to feel as contented as babies in their
          mothers' arms.

          The Earthlings did very well on paper. That was part of the rigging, of course. And religion got mixed
          up in it, too. The news ticker reminded them that the President of the United States had declared
          National Prayer Week, and that everybody should pray. The Earthlings had had a bad week on the
          market before that. They had lost a small fortune in olive oil futures. So they gave praying a whirl.
          It worked. Olive oil went up.

          Another Kilgore Trout book there in the window was about a man who built a time machine so he
          could go back and see Jesus. It worked, and he saw Jesus when Jesus was only twelve years old. Jesus
          was learning the carpentry trade from his father.

          Two Roman soldiers came into the shop with a mechanical drawing on papyrus of a device they
          wanted built by sunrise the next morning. It was a cross to be used in the execution of a rabble-rouser.
          Jesus and his father built it. They were glad to have the work. And the rabble-rouser was executed on
          it.

          So it goes...

          The time-traveler in the book went back to Bible times to find out one thing in particular: Whether or
          not Jesus had really died on the cross, or whether he had been taken down while still alive, whether he
          had really gone on living. The hero had a stethoscope along.

          Billy skipped to the end of the book, where the hero mingled with the people who were taking Jesus
          down from the cross. The time-traveler was the first one up the ladder, dressed in clothes of the period,
          and he leaned close to Jesus so people couldn't see him use the stethoscope, and he listened.

          There wasn't a sound inside the emaciated chest cavity. The Son of God was as dead as a doornail.

          So it goes.
