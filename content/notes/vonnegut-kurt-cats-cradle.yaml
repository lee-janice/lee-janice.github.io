          Call me Jonah. My parents did, or nearly did. They called me John.
          Jonah — John — if I had been a Sam, I would have been a Jonah still — not
          because I have been unlucky for others, but because somebody or something has
          compelled me to be certain places at certain times, without fail. Conveyances
          and motives, both conventional and bizarre, have been provided. And, according
          to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place this Jonah was there.

          We Bokononists believe that humanity is organized into teams, teams that do
          God's Will without ever discovering what they are doing. Such a team is called a
          karass by Bokonon, and the instrument, the kan-kan, that brought me into my
          own particular karass was the book I never finished, the book to be called The
          Day the World Ended.

          Nowhere does Bokonon warn against a person's trying to discover the limits
          of his karass and the nature of the work God Almighty has had it do. Bokonon
          simply observes that such investigations are bound to be incomplete.

          The first sentence in The Books of Bokonon is this:
          “All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.”
          My Bokononist warning is this:
          Anyone unable to understand how a useful religion can be founded on lies
          will not understand this book either.
          So be it.

          There are lots of other good
          anecdotes about the bomb and Father, from other days. For instance, do you
          know the story about Father on the day they first tested a bomb out at
          Alamogordo? After the thing went off, after it was a sure thing that America
          could wipe out a city with just one bomb, a scientist turned to Father and said,
          ‘Science has now known sin.’ And do you know what Father said? He said,
          ‘What is Sin?’

          Anything can be a wampeter: a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a

          it in the majestic chaos of a spiral nebula. The orbits of the members of a karass
          about their common wampeter are spiritual orbits, naturally. It is souls and not

          line, with the example of the wrang-wrang’s own life, to an absurdity.

          Newt’s painting was small and black and warty.
          It consisted of scratches made in a black, gummy impasto. The scratches

          It is not possible to make a mistake,” she assured me. I did not know that
          this was a customary greeting given by all Bokononists when meeting a shy
          person. So, I responded with a feverish discussion of whether it was possible to
          make a mistake or not.

          “That you love?”
          “I love everyone.”
          “As — as much as me?”
          “Yes.” She seemed to have no idea that this might bother me.

          “Not even God, as near as I can tell.”
          “Nothing?”
          “Just one thing.”

          “Gott mate mutt,” crooned Dr. von Koenigswald.
          “Dyot meet mat,” echoed “Papa” Monzano.
          “God made mud,” was what they’d said, each in his own dialect. I will here
          abandon the dialects of the litany.
          “God got lonesome,” said Von Koenigswald.
          “God got lonesome.”
          “So God said to some of the mud, ‘Sit up!’ ”
          “So God said to some of the mud, ‘Sit up!’ ”
          “ ‘See all I’ve made,’ said God, ‘the hills, the sea, the sky, the stars.’ ”

          “And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around.”
          “And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around.”
          “Lucky me; lucky mud.”
          “Lucky me, lucky mud.” Tears were streaming down “Papa’s” cheeks.
          “I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done.”
          “I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done.”
          “Nice going, God!”
          “Nice going, God!” “Papa” said it with all his heart.
          “Nobody but You could have done it, God! I certainly couldn’t have.”
          “Nobody but You could have done it, God! I certainly couldn’t have.”
          “I feel very unimportant compared to You.”
          “I feel very unimportant compared to You.”
          “The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that
          didn’t even get to sit up and look around.”
          “The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that
          didn’t even get to sit up and look around.”
          “I got so much, and most mud got so little.”
          “I got so much, and most mud got so little.”
          “Deng you vore da on-oh!” cried Von Koenigswald.
          “Tz-yenk voo vore lo yon-yo!” wheezed “Papa.”
          What they had said was, “Thank you for the honor!”
          “Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep.”
          “Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep.”
          “What memories for mud to have!”
          “What memories for mud to have!”
          “What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met!”
          “What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met!”
          “I loved everything I saw!”
          “I loved everything I saw!”
          “Good night.”
          “Good night.”
          “I will go to heaven now.”
          “I will go to heaven now.”
          “I can hardly wait...”
          “I can hardly wait...”

          ‘Papa’ for just a moment. He was raving...”
          “What about?” I asked.
          “Pain, ice, Mona — everything. And then ‘Papa’ said, ‘Now I will destroy
          the whole world.’ ”
          “What did he mean by that?”
          “It’s what Bokononists always say when they are about to commit suicide.”
          Von Koenigswald went to a basin of water, meaning to wash his hands. “When I
          turned to look at him,” he told me, his hands poised over the water, “he was dead
          — as hard as a statue, just as you see him. I brushed my fingers over his lips.
          They looked so peculiar.”
          He put his hands into the water. “What chemical could possibly...” The
          question trailed off.
          Von Koenigswald raised his hands, and the water in the basin came with
          them. It was no longer water, but a hemisphere of ice-nine.
          Von Koenigswald touched the tip of his tongue to the blue-white mystery.
          Frost bloomed on his lips. He froze solid, tottered, and crashed.
          The blue-white hemisphere shattered. Chunks skittered over the floor.
          I went to the door and bawled for help.
          Soldiers and servants came running.
          I ordered them to bring Frank and Newt and Angela to “Papa’s” room at
          once.
          At last I had seen ice-nine!

          And I remembered The Fourteenth Book of Bokonon, which I had read in its
          entirety the night before. The Fourteenth Book is entitled, “What Can a
          Thoughtful Man Hope for Mankind on Earth, Given the Experience of the Past
          Million Years?”
          It doesn’t take long to read The Fourteenth Book. It consists of one word and
          a period.
          This is it:
          “Nothing.”

          There was a sound like that of the gentle closing of a portal as big as the sky,
          the great door of heaven being closed softly. It was a grand AH-WHOOM.
          I opened my eyes — and all the sea was ice-nine. The moist green earth was
          a blue-white pearl. The sky darkened. Borasisi, the sun, became a sickly yellow
          ball, tiny and cruel.
          The sky was filled with worms. The worms were tornadoes.

          In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in His cosmic
          loneliness.
          And God said, “Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see
          what We have done.” And God created every living creature that now moveth,
          and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud as
          man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked. “What is the purpose of all
          this?” he asked politely.
          “Everything must have a purpose?” asked God.
          “Certainly,” said man.
          “Then I leave it to you to think of one for all this,” said God.
          And He went away.

          I recalled a thing I had read about the aboriginal Tasmanians, habitually
          naked persons who, when encountered by white men in the seventeenth century,
          were strangers to agriculture, animal husbandry, architecture of any sort, and
          possibly even fire. They were so contemptible in the eyes of white men, by
          reason of their ignorance, that they were hunted for sport by the first settlers,
          who were convicts from England. And the aborigines found life so unattractive
          that they gave up reproducing.
          I suggested to Newt now that it was a similar hopelessness that had
          unmanned us.
          Newt made a shrewd observation. “I guess all the excitement in bed had
          more to do with excitement about keeping the human race going than anybody
          ever imagined.”

          show him how empty of symbols they were. “But what in hell would the right
