          They did not speak, they did not sing, they
          remained generally silent, almost determinedly silent; but from the empty air they
          conjured music. Everything was music, the lifting and setting down of their feet,
          certain turns of the head, their running and their standing still, the positions they took
          up in relation to one another, the symmetrical patterns which they produced by one
          dog setting his front paws on the back of another and the rest following suit until the
          first bore the weight of the other six, or by all lying flat on the ground and going
          through complicated concerted evolutions; and none made a false move, not even the
          last dog...

          But now from my hiding hole I saw, on looking more closely, that it was
          not so much coolness as the most extreme tension that characterized their
          performance; these limbs apparently so sure in their movements quivered at every step
          with a perpetual apprehensive twitching; as if rigid with despair the dogs kept their
          eyes fixed on one another, and their tongues, whenever the tension weakened for a
          moment, hung wearily from their jowls. It could not be fear of failure that agitated
          them so deeply; dogs that could dare and achieve such things had no need to fear that.
          Then why were they afraid? Who then forced them to do what they were doing?

          I rushed about, told my story, asked questions, made accusations and investigations,
          tried to drag others to the place where all this had happened, and burned to show
          everybody where I had stood and where the seven had stood, and where and how they
          had danced and made their music; and if anyone had come with me, instead of shaking
          me off and laughing at me, I would probably have sacrificed my innocence and tried
          myself to stand on my hind legs so as to reconstruct the scene clearly.

          I began my inquiries with the simplest things; there was no lack of material; it is
          the actual superabundance, unfortunately, that casts me into despair in my darker
          hours. I began to inquire into the question what the canine race nourished itself upon.
          Now that is, if you like, by no means a simple question, of course; it has occupied us
          since the dawn of time, it is the chief object of all our meditation, countless
          observations and essays and views on this subject have been published, it has grown
          into a province of knowledge which in its prodigious compass is not only beyond the
          comprehension of any single scholar, but of all our scholars collectively, a burden
          which cannot be borne except by the whole of the dog community, and even then with
          difficulty and not quite in its totality; for it ever and again crumbles away like a
          neglected ancestral inheritance and must laboriously be rehabilitated anew -- not to
          speak at all of the difficulties and almost unfulfillable conditions of my investigation.

          ...my question,
          however, is the following: "Whence does the earth procure this food?" A question
          which people in general pretend not to understand, and to which the best answer they
          can give is: "If you haven't enough to eat, we'll give you some of ours.

          For what is there actually except our own species? To whom but it can
          one appeal in the wide and empty world? All knowledge, the totality of all questions
          and all answers, is contained in the dog. If one could but realize this knowledge, if one
          could but bring it into the light of day, if we dogs would but own that we know
          infinitely more than we admit to ourselves! ...everything
          is directed toward achieving an ecstasy, a forgetting and finding again; but the one
          thing that you long to win above all, the admission of knowledge, remains denied to
          you. To such prayers, whether silent or loud, the only answers you get, even after you
          have employed your powers of seduction to the utmost, are vacant stares, averted
          glances, troubled and veiled eyes. It is much the same as it was when, a mere puppy, I
          shouted to the dog musicians and they remained silent.

          I understand my fellow dogs, am flesh of their flesh, of
          their miserable, ever-renewed, ever-desirous flesh. But it is not merely flesh and blood
          that we have in common, but knowledge also, and not only knowledge, but the key to
          it as well. I do not possess that key except in common with all the others; I cannot
          grasp it without their help. The hardest bones, containing the richest marrow, can be
          conquered only by a united crunching of all the teeth of all dogs. ...I want to
          compel all dogs thus to assemble together, I want the bones to crack open under the
          pressure of their collective preparedness, and then I want to dismiss them to the
          ordinary life that they love, while all by myself, quite alone, I lap up the marrow. That
          sounds monstrous, almost as if I wanted to feed on the marrow, not merely of a bone,
          but of the whole canine race itself. But it is only a metaphor. The marrow that I am
          discussing here is no food; on the contrary, it is a poison.

          But far more strange to my mind is the senselessness, the
          dumb senselessness of these existences. They have no relation whatever to the general
          life of the community, they hover in the air, and that is all, and life goes on its usual
          way; someone now and then refers to art and artists, but there it ends. But why, my
          good dogs, why on earth do these dogs float in the air? What sense is there in their
          occupation? Why can one get no word of explanation regarding them? Why do they
          hover up there, letting their legs, the pride of dogs, fall into desuetude, preserving a
          detachment from the nourishing earth, reaping without having sowed, being
          particularly well provided for, as I hear, and at the cost of the dog community too.

          Certainly the fate of types like mine must be a strange one 
          ...We are the dogs who are crushed by the silence, who
          long to break through it, literally to get a breath of fresh air; the others seem to thrive
          on silence: true, that is only so in appearance, as in the case of the musical dogs, who
          ostensibly were quite calm when they played, but in reality were in a state of intense
          excitement; nevertheless the illusion is very strong, one tries to make a breach in it,
          but it mocks every attempt. What help, then, do my colleagues find? What kind of
          attempts do they make to manage to go on living in spite of everything?

          People often praise the universal progress made by the dog community
          throughout the ages, and probably mean by that more particularly the progress in
          knowledge. Certainly knowledge is progressing, its advance is irresistible, it actually
          progresses at an accelerating speed, always faster, but what is there to praise in that? It
          is as if one were to praise someone because with the years he grows older, and in
          consequence comes nearer and nearer to death with increasing speed.

          Even in those days wonders did not openly walk the streets for anyone to seize; but all the
          same, dogs -- I cannot put it in any other way -- had not yet become so doggish as
          today, the edifice of dogdom was still loosely put together, the true Word could still
          have intervened, planning or replanning the structure, changing it at will,
          transforming it into its opposite; and the Word was there, was very near at least, on
          the tip of everybody's tongue, anyone might have hit upon it. And what has become of
          it today? Today one may pluck out one's very heart and not find it. Our generation is
          lost, it may be, but it is more blameless than those earlier ones. I can understand the
          hesitation of my generation, indeed it is no longer mere hesitation; it is the thousandth
          forgetting of a dream dreamt a thousand times and forgotten a thousand times; and
          who can damn us merely for forgetting for the thousandth time?

          But it seems to me that
          science nevertheless takes a veiled interest, at least to some extent, in these matters,
          inasmuch as it recognizes two chief methods of procuring food; namely the actual
          preparation of the ground, and secondly the auxiliary perfecting processes of
          incantation, dance, and song. I find here a distinction in accordance with the one I
          have myself made; not a definitive distinction, perhaps, but yet clear enough. The
          scratching and watering of the ground, in my opinion, serves to produce both kinds of
          food, and remains indispensable; incantation, dance, and song, however, are
          concerned less with the ground food in the narrower sense, and serve principally to
          attract the food from above.

          In certain circumstances I might have been able to achieve an almost scrupulously exact
          experiment; namely, if I had succeeded only once in bringing down food by an upward
          incantation without preparing the ground at all, and then had failed to extract food by
          an incantation directed exclusively to the ground. I attempted indeed something of
          this kind, but without any real belief in it and without the conditions being quite
          perfect; for it is my fixed opinion that a certain amount of ground-preparation is
          always necessary, and even if the heretics who deny this are right, their theory can
          never be proved in any case, seeing that the watering of the ground is done under a
          kind of compulsion, and within certain limits simply cannot be avoided.

          But in isolated cases something else
          happened, something really strange; the food did not fall but followed me through the
          air; the food pursued the hungry. That never went on for long, always for only a short
          stretch, then the food fell after all, or vanished completely, or -- the most common
          case -- my greed put a premature end to the experiment and I swallowed down the
          tempting food... It only proved what was already
          known, that the ground not only attracts food vertically from above, but also at a slant,
          indeed sometimes in spirals... I wished to prove that
          when I retreated before the food it was not the ground that attracted it at a slant, but I
          who drew it after me.

          I resolved to fast completely as long as I could stand it, and at the same time avoid all sight of food, all
          temptation. If I were to withdraw myself in this manner, remain lying day and night
          with closed eyes, trouble myself neither to snatch food from the air nor to lift it from
          the ground, and if, as I dared not expect, yet faintly hoped, without taking any of the
          customary measures, and merely in response to the unavoidable irrational watering of
          the ground and the quiet recitation of the incantations and songs (the dance I wished
          to omit, so as not to weaken my powers) the food were to come of itself from above,
          and without going near the ground were to knock at my teeth for admittance -- if that

          "What are you doing
          here?" he asked. "You must leave this place." "I can't leave it just now," I said, without
          trying to explain, for how could I explain everything to him; besides, he seemed to be
          in a hurry. "Please go away," he said, impatiently lifting his feet and setting them down
          again. "Let me be," I said, "leave me to myself and don't worry about me; the others
          on't." "I ask you to go for your own sake," he said. "You can ask for any reason you
          like," I replied. "I can't go even if I wanted to." "You need have no fear of that," he said,
          smiling. "You can go all right. It's because you seem to be feeble that I ask you to go
          now, and you can go slowly if you like; if you linger now you'll have to race off later
          on." "That's my affair," I replied. "It's mine too," he said, saddened by my stubbornness... 
          And I gazed at him -- he had merely shaken
          his head sadly at my rough answer -- with ever mounting desire. "Who are you?" I
          asked. "I'm a hunter," he replied.

          as no dog before me had ever seen, at least there is no slightest hint of it in our
          tradition, and I hastily bowed my head in infinite fear and shame in the pool of blood
          lying before me. I thought I saw that the hound was already singing without knowing
          it, nay, more, that the melody, separated from him, was floating on the air in
          accordance with its own laws, and, as though he had no part in it, was moving toward
          me, toward me alone. Today, of course, I deny the validity of all such perceptions and
          ascribe them to my overexcitation at that time, but even if it was an error it had
          nevertheless a sort of grandeur, and is the sole, even if delusive, reality that I have
          carried over into this world from my period of fasting, and shows at least how far we
          can go when we are beyond ourselves.

          Of course, quite apart from the circumstances already mentioned, the reason for that can
          be found in my incapacity for scientific investigation, my limited powers of thought,
          my bad memory, but above all in my inability to keep my scientific aim continuously
          before my eyes. It was this instinct that made
