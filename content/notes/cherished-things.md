[^1]:
    The full title of the album is: _When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king /
    What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight /
    And he'll win the whole thing 'fore he enters the ring /
    There's no body to batter when your mind is your might /
    So when you go solo, you hold your own hand /
    And remember that depth is the greatest of heights /
    And if you know where you stand, then you know where to land /
    And if you fall it won't matter, cuz you'll know that you're right_
