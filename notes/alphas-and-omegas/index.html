My Grandfather Verus. Character and self-control.
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>You&#x27;ve lived as a citizen in a great city. Five years or a hundred—what&#x27;s  the difference? The laws make no distinction. And to be sent away from it,  not by a tyrant or a dishonest judge, but by Nature, who first invited you  in—why is that so terrible? Like the impresario ringing down the curtain on  an actor: &quot;But I&#x27;ve only gotten through three acts...!&quot; Yes. This will be a  drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that directed your creation,  and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours to determine. So make your  exit with grace—the same grace shown to you.
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>Alice in Wonderland<!-- --> by <!-- -->Lewis<!-- --> <!-- -->Carroll</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, &quot;and what is the use of a book,&quot; thought Alice, &quot;without pictures or conversation?&quot;
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>The Sun My Heart<!-- --> by <!-- -->Thich Nhat<!-- --> <!-- -->Hahn</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>Today three children, two girls and a little boy, came from the village to play with Thanh Thuy (pronounced &quot;Tahn Tui&quot;).
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>All is in the word &quot;know.&quot; To know is to realize. Realization is mindfulness. All the work of meditation is aimed at awakening us in order to know one and only one thing: birth and death can never touch us in any way whatsoever.
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>Investigations of a Dog<!-- --> by <!-- -->Franz<!-- --> <!-- -->Kafka</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>How much my life has changed, and yet how unchanged it has remained at bottom!
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>Of course, quite apart from the circumstances already mentioned, the reason for that can be found in my incapacity for scientific investigation, my limited powers of thought, my bad memory, but above all in my inability to keep my scientific aim continuously before my eyes. It was this instinct that made me -- and perhaps for the sake of science itself, but a different science from that of today, an ultimate science -- prize freedom higher than everything else. Freedom! Certainly such freedom as is possible today is a wretched business. But nevertheless freedom, nevertheless a possession.
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>The Trial<!-- --> by <!-- -->Franz<!-- --> <!-- -->Kafka</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>Someone must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having done  anything wrong, he was arrested.
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>&quot;Like a dog!&quot; he said; it seemed as though the shame was to outlive him.
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>East of Eden<!-- --> by <!-- -->John<!-- --> <!-- -->Steinbeck</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>The Salinas Valley is in Northern California. It is a long narrow swale between two ranges of mountains, and the Salinas River winds and twists up the center until it falls at last into Monterey Bay.
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>Lee whispered, &quot;Thank you, Adam —thank you, my friend. Can you move your lips? Make your lips form his name.&quot; Adam looked up with sick weariness. His lips parted and failed and tried again. Then his lungs filled. He expelled the air and his lips combed the rushing sigh. His whispered word seemed to hang in the air: &quot;Timshel!&quot; His eyes closed and he slept.
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>Cat&#x27;s Cradle<!-- --> by <!-- -->Kurt<!-- --> <!-- -->Vonnegut</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>Call me Jonah. My parents did, or nearly did. They called me John. Jonah — John — if I had been a Sam, I would have been a Jonah still — not because I have been unlucky for others, but because somebody or something has compelled me to be certain places at certain times, without fail. Conveyances and motives, both conventional and bizarre, have been provided. And, according to plan, at each appointed second, at each appointed place this Jonah was there.
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>If I were a younger man, I would write a history of human stupidity; and I would climb to the top of Mount McCabe and lie down on my back with my history for a pillow; and I would take from the ground some of the blue-white poison that makes statues of men; and I would make a statue of myself, lying on my back, grinning horribly, and thumbing my nose at You Know Who.
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>The Sirens of Titan<!-- --> by <!-- -->Kurt<!-- --> <!-- -->Vonnegut</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>Everyone now knows how to find the meaning of life within himself. 
But mankind wasn&#x27;t always so lucky. Less than a century ago men and women did not have
easy access to the puzzle boxes within them.
They could not name even one of the fifty-three portals to the soul.
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>Salo had hypnotized him so that he would imagine, as he died, that he saw his best and only friend, Stony Stevenson. As the snow drifted over Constant, he imagined that the clouds opened up, letting through a sunbeam, a sunbeam all for him. A golden space ship encrusted with diamonds came skimming down the sunbeam, landed in the untouched snow of the street. Out stepped a stocky, red-headed man with a big cigar. He was young. He wore the uniform of the Martian Assault Infantry, Unk&#x27;s old outfit. &quot;Hello, Unk,&quot; he said. &quot;Get in.&quot; &quot;Get in?&quot; said Constant. &quot;Who are you?&quot; &quot;Stony Stevenson, Unk. You don&#x27;t recognize me?&quot; &quot;Stony?&quot; said Constant. &quot;That&#x27;s you, Stony?&quot; &quot;Who else could stand the bloody pace?&quot; said Stony. He laughed. &quot;Get in,&quot; he said. &quot;And go where?&quot; said Constant. &quot;Paradise,&quot; said Stony. &quot;What&#x27;s Paradise like?&quot; said Constant. &quot;Everybody&#x27;s happy there forever,&quot; said Stony, &quot;or as long as the bloody Universe holds together. Get in, Unk. Beatrice is already there, waiting for you.&quot; &quot;Beatrice?&quot; said Unk, getting into the space ship. Stony closed the airlocks, pressed the on button. &quot;We&#x27;re — we&#x27;re going to Paradise now?&quot; said Constant. &quot;I — I&#x27;m going to get into Paradise?&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me why, old sport,&quot; said Stony, &quot;but somebody up there likes you.&quot;
</p><br/><hr/></div><div><h1>Slaughterhouse-Five<!-- --> by <!-- -->Kurt<!-- --> <!-- -->Vonnegut</h1><h2>The Beginning</h2><p>All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn&#x27;t his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I&#x27;ve changed all the names.
</p><h2>The End</h2><p>And somewhere in there was springtime.The corpse mines were closed down.The soldiers all left to fight the Russians.In the suburbs, the women and children dug rifle pits.Billy and the rest of his group were locked up in the stable in the suburbs.And then, one morning, they got up to discover that the door was unlocked.The Second World War in Europe was over.
Billy and the rest wandered out onto the shady street.The trees were leafing out.There was nothing going on out there, no traffic of any kind.There was only one vehicle, an abandoned wagon drawn by two horses.The wagon was green and coffin-shaped.
Birds were talking.
One bird said to Billy Pilgrim, &#x27;Poo-tee-weet?
